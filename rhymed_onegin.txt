see the descriptions  of the Finnish winter in  Baratynskys Eda
have gnawed our bridges and the flea
diversely urging the same plea
o russia
moscow loved daughter of russia
friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila
in adam Smith was his diploma
i too  when I recall svetlana
and melancholy as svetlana
thou my svetlana
then sudden fear attacked tatyana
onegins letter to tatyana
but tell me which one was tatyana
princess mon ange Pachette alina
album and stays Princess alina
akulka the onetime Selina
praskovya rebaptized Polina
swapped it for odd tomes of Malvina
how long can you  Dearest kuzina
and in the district this persona
archrake pothouse tribunepersona
a liar still Lyubv Petrovna
still powdered is Lukrya Lvovna
dianas breast the cheeks of Flora
idol mio or Benedetta
buynov whirls off Pustyakova
tatyana on Miss Kharlikova
and then old cousin Pelagya
but now my brain is darkened tanya
im old my mind is blunted tanya
i reckon by Gods will My vanya
my mind is fuddled Tell me nyanya
how slow you are at guessing nyanya
how did you come to marry nyanya
it was goodbye Monsieur lAbb
and slowly day begins to climb
the nightly luminaries climb
and rest his dear bones in the tomb
presses its forebears to the tomb
stands over my poor nurses tomb
down in our damp earthmothers womb
but i in love was dull and dumb
is spleen his trouble or the dumb
ivn Petrvich still is dumb
and telling trochee from iambic
he was without that dithyrambic
or for a lamentable manic
a monster of the gens Satanic
remember the retort satiric
and the deepthroated billows choric
how oft shed lead me by the Tauric
is others View that clever lyric
militaryfoppish diplomatic
he informed this envoy diplomatic
eugenes response was automatic
through the tight ranks  aristocratic
she finds in order alphabetic
searching the table exegetic
of spring he lives hes energetic
he leaves one morning the hermetic
that world where every mans a critic
but soft You hear A scowling critic
no deathless truths nothing scholastic
of unaffectedly fantastic
the elegy grown paralytic
boo Phaedra out as paralytic
now lensky would it be so bad
the horses as they sense the dead
to life grew colder than the dead
some are far distant some are dead
they rise and ripen and fall dead
the happiness of youth is dead
goes out of us when youth is dead
where to God knows The trail is dead
of entertaining the halfdead
the greyhaired nurse with kerchiefed head
first snow for shoulders breast and head
lel floats about above her head
slumber still floats above his head
and silently he hung his head
with storm and tumult in his head
a single thing to her his head
talk that might turn a young girls head
the ballroom drove me off my head
rapture was just two weeks ahead
on the dull life that bachelors lead
and kept quite silent while she read
can disavow that I have read
in friendly gatherings where i read
but olga would have never read
and for belle Nina as it read
you in my arms on gingerbread
for tanya winters ways are dread
vanishes with his load of dread
which with a blush he leaves unread
on which a carpet has been spread
before the fire a tables spread
just like on turf your fleeting tread
tries out the ice with cautious tread
others will follow where they tread
but now grown plain and kind in stead
but thats enough at once in stead
anticipates a swim in stead
to blow his brains out but in stead
hes put belle Tatiana instead
his wife just like Tatyana had
on richardson gone raving mad
to drive the swooning senses mad
with amber pipes from Tsaregrad
youre really going Well Im sad
and doctors hed have died in bed
one smoothes the pillows down in bed
tanyas undressed and lies in bed
at last he wakes and stirs in bed
tatyana simply lay in bed
billiards are dropped cue put to bed
on a small bench by Tanyas bed
beside the windowsill that bed
in sultry sleep in lonely bed
his transports and the marriagebed
oe devotedly inlaced
with charming forefinger she traced
take any novel clearly traced
where admonitions are pronounced
where nowadays Im soundly trounced
at first onegins tongue produced
now lovelaces renown has faded
and heartless pleasure was upgraded
some regimental bard has added
a stanza villainously padded
why olgas younger and shes bedded
always comes back Ill not be wedded
hed sack the Muses and get wedded
not for the first time he succeeded
agree the way Eugene proceeded
always before the volume ended
the crash of plates and knives is blended
helping the poor or while I mended
they buzz  but then all talks suspended
should your perfections be expended
with balm of prayer my torn and rended
always our fervid hero tended
loved someone else not her intended
but i was simply not intended
you know its true how I attended
in the two sisters rooms extended
amongst the crafty and smallminded
both dull and ludicrous the bunded
poor lensky where the tomb is bounded
high ceilings everywhere abounded
in which so lately it abounded
was the sad poet not confounded
here stands with shady park surrounded
in the saloon brocadesurrounded
there was a period when coldblooded
these lines and the first twelve lines of stanza XLVII were discarded
her father kindly wellregarded
but in an earlier age retarded
im sick my dear Im sick indeed
eugene with solemn face paid heed
had drawn Eugenes especial heed
but youre not paying any heed
touches obliquely but with speed
is brought to table at full speed
pursuits of a monotonous breed
begot by boredom out of greed
the draught whose blessings are agreed
and where hed silently agreed
how long is it And since I fed
for his old courses to be changed
for happiness i sought and ranged
and glad he was hed thus arranged
unloved and friendless and estranged
midst crones with endless tears to shed
whither oh whither are ye banished
oh when and to what desert banished
my goddesses Where are you banished
by chance those verses havent vanished
have other maidens since you vanished
my little feet where have you vanished
in fashion thats halfglad halfanguished
that table where the lamp has languished
to talk to her but language died
lensky that tragic victim died
his nature would be changed and steadied
debauchery was praised and studied
people there were he glorified
hes dreadfully dissatisfied
with a consumption theyve relied
if suddenly aloft she spied
who that fat general Tanya cried
of the old Tatyana Eugene tried
with a first click the catch is tried
she lacked her sisters beauty lacked
eugene at Olgas side was racked
you left no steps that could be tracked
suggests a victim richly decked
profoundly sunk Tatyana stalked
the bear  what next  behind her stalked
for hours alone she walked and walked
her way she passed then as she walked
wildly the fearful laughter pealed
monsters the maiden stood revealed
the impatient conqueror was humbled
but suddenly a snowdrift rumbled
and what came out a hairy tumbled
but no my Moscow never stumbled
fever of rhyme thereby hes doubled
the pangs with which his heart was troubled
meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled
a sudden clatter blood was curdled
the lady of the house has fled
another and his memorys fled
the samovar of evening boiled
beneath it vapour wreathed and coiled
for what charade is he apparelled
beneath a shroud thats all dishevelled
the bank the immobile stream are levelled
enormous bear Tatyana yelled
in bed a young man stiff and chilled
evgeny looks at Lensky chilled
well what the neighbour says hes killed
he hears a voice well what hes killed
foes friends and loves their voice is stilled
down from his Kalmuck steed he rolled
the eager players are enrolled
whose heart experience has cooled
and saved from being charmed or fooled
yet once for him her thoughts had whirled
his hair was fashionably curled
hymnal as endlessly unfurled
he found all kinds of brickbat hurled
could it be she or had he dreamed
but just then Eugenes pistol flamed
the girl hed scorned in what he deemed
and lensky left eye closing aimed
the jealous poets gloom is lightened
hes host thats obvious Thus enlightened
knowing the offender hed been frightened
tanyas no longer quite so frightened
but i myself read my bedizened
to nobody except a wizened
below the others who have signed
approaches Olga Lenskys signed
her bow as calm and as restrained
her manner is no less contained
he watched the guests and as he dined
has something low and unrefined
her feelings were far more inclined
for several days she peaked and pined
is in your poetry enshrined
sweet words by which her pain was banned
for whom her passion has been planned
and pledged to you and firmly planned
dont let me stray in paths unplanned
who in that flash could not have reckoned
no dream Youd scarce arrived i reckoned
i had most surely never reckoned
was that calm brow of one who swooned
to wiser words and deeds and learned
away so cool so unconcerned
in quilted dressinggown adorned
and in the country blissful horned
could it be she who just had turned
to my young days its time i turned
then to the altar to be crowned
had with its brilliant mantle crowned
in darkest forest depths and drowned
to meet the unhappy poet skipped
just as shed always been she tripped
tatyana went with them and sped
and where most surely notes are sped
her girlhood games in them hed shared
a treasure never to be shared
as something not to be declared
at any time hed be prepared
on olga from hearts ache still spared
in terms where not a word was spared
at twenty was a fop inbred
perhaps no more sensations lumbered
or as by Lethes bank he slumbered
how many follies were engendered
friends recollect how I surrendered
her tender touch had never fingered
the needle never had she lingered
pushkin first wrote imperial portraits but this he later altered
and nothing in her look is altered
however much her soul has faltered
no notice of them But Ive chattered
if you come with me theyll be flattered
onegin my good friend was littered
reader or where youve shone and glittered
that not a syllable be uttered
in these last years all mixed and fluttered
the aunts exchanged a look they fluttered
they nudged Tatyana and each muttered
i dont mean that she never shivered
no even her eyebrow never quivered
our lives were flat and what had fired
he almost lost his mind expired
both hearts to blaze had now expired
would have been all that we required
whom thirty centuries have adored
far far from Italy his adored
from all the world they sat and pored
past all endurance Youre referred
and not because shed once preferred
or halfunwittingly preferred
filled him with thoughts that swarmed and whirred
in quiet flood A beetle whirred
beyond the stream there smoked and stirred
threw Eugene at her feet  she stirred
no sound by which her soul is stirred
on eugene he was deeply stirred
it was that hed been truly stirred
deep in moldavia the abhorred
that sat above the stove and purred
the silence when our talk had ceased
she brought her talents never ceased
with neighbour Lensky the deceased
like convicts in a dream released
hold half the world still unreleased
for long for evermore Weve chased
the earth for him grew dumb and closed
in warmer airs was half dispersed
when on the plain green herbs are massed
the time to go has long since passed
of inexperience would have passed
unforced as conversation passed
forests where my young age was passed
shes their great friend asked in caressed
is in voluptuous languor dressed
whispered by heart a note addressed
her hands affectionately pressed
where folded arms are tightly pressed
was by forebodings much oppressed
words mispronounced thoughts illexpressed
with whom your thoughts are so obsessed
still on the board the beakers hissed
no one was ever so engrossed
a haze in me but I grew used
struck down as if shed been accused
he thought that Olgad be confused
to whom your hearts are dedicated
to which so oft weve dedicated
and flynov amply lubricated
napoleon here intoxicated
but for the effect that he created
in darkness in her room or treated
hes always with her either seated
theyve moved around and been reseated
the clock of doom had struck as fated
she fell in love  the hour was fated
for aeons Maybe it was fated
they buried Uncle congregated
its nullity Ive always hated
he was no fool appreciated
he drives in brilliant sun striated
that year the season was belated
as ive so oft in jest related
lensky ingenuously related
by all is sweetly mutilated
lensky rejoiced His designated
while marmotlike he hibernated
tatyana watched the moon and floated
on waves of far niente floated
of secret pain but its now rated
to eat and drink then separated
with tolstoys brush or decorated
his tale of youthful love narrated
the thought sank in and penetrated
on diningchairs are all prostrated
portfolios nobly illustrated
so glut yourselves until youre sated
can it be true and firmly stated
seeing vladimir had defected
the tomcat mannered and affected
a bit provincial and affected
quite selfabsorbed and unaffected
as infant sleep or the unaffected
his bow was wholly unaffected
his strangeness wholly unaffected
in french Onegin had perfected
he sang of love to love subjected
which held him silently subjected
assembly silent and dejected
not the plain timorous dejected
the crown of marriage was projected
the noise their rustic wheels projected
where scribbling friends have interjected
shed never join the game selected
but who stands there in this selected
undressed by candlelight selected
by fresh ennui as he reflected
of light that flowering fields reflected
give for a bookshelf a neglected
a park enormous and neglected
whenever nyanya had collected
before onegin there collected
and although Troys greybeards collected
around priam the muchrespected
once home he brought out and inspected
however closely he inspected
often of course youll have inspected
that visitors must be expected
his father died and as expected
they find her somewhat unexpected
and the churchyard where newerected
and my whole life has been directed
singing in chorus as directed
but my Eugene that night directed
once on the highway hed detected
there was no trace to be detected
thronged by adorers Ive detected
their masters berries undetected
i know godsent one Im protected
by deep and shady woods protected
by now whists heroes have completed
and whist thats now so keenly fted
from dish of water rings are shifted
with tufts of snow and through the lifted
in due succession hers is lifted
no path to see the snow has drifted
above a stream the moon had lighted
his soul still blossomed out and lighted
and suddenly her radiance lighted
he was too young to have been blighted
of swaddling clothes  already blighted
suddenly from a crest she sighted
of five more steps they went slowgaited
that on the worlds staircase there waited
expecting winter nature waited
with recent fortune vainly waited
loves crown delectable awaited
now by green tablecloths awaited
she sang of childhoods fun indited
the headpiecetext is thus indited
where is the fire that once ignited
where two old pinetrees stand united
winter The countryman enchanted
his nag has smelt the snow and planted
yet  fear itself she found presented
sometimes a landscapes represented
she grew accustomed and contented
in tears and violent tossing vented
our disposition being invented
a tomb a Cyprian shrines invented
lensky of course was quite untainted
instead the chance to get acquainted
his minds eye focused on the hinted
between the lines of text as printed
the vales dry out grow brightly printed
the downy woods are greenertinted
since earliest boyhood he had doted
with tenderness hed watched and noted
a thought was born and quickly noted
to harmless idleness devoted
but it was passion that preempted
from that rough spell at last exempted
to the hero that shed adopted
she sighed and in a trance coopted
a foe  our mood should be warmhearted
poor yorick said he brokenhearted
outside the gate Tatyana parted
but soon the ways we trod were parted
reader i wish that as we parted
sadly he mourned for the departed
treaties of nations long departed
between them every topic started
at earliest morning out she started
eugene would willingly have started
so there she stood forlorn deserted
now for the first time shes escorted
was she the Tanya hed exhorted
of this our novel we reported
jealously shyly Ive imported
which smilingly your friend supported
she was like him and always sported
but without asking they transported
a hundred times afresh distorted
and long as if through mists that spurted
eugene turned countryman He tasted
till then had been dispersed and wasted
he found too much that he regretted
with reason too for when hed vetted
forehead he strummed his vision flitted
before the clavichord with knitted
that shes so trustful and imbued
by heaven with such an unsubdued
with grave goodbyes to the bereaved
the strophe over which I slaved
had long been wasting and enslaved
by pain and languishment she craved
for maybe fortune will have saved
as if some goal had been achieved
russian pancakes were always served
sweet old tradition was preserved
conclude that its high time she wed
by now his bridetobe has wed
at thirty lucratively wed
paterfamilias unwed
perhaps for fame he was endowed
and blood had bubbled as it flowed
and hope and passion life had glowed
and happy licence are allowed
by sluggish Lethe may be swallowed
the trail the youthful poet followed
the carriage of the newlywed
a stride on Petrarchs path allayed
and soon will days bright tune be played
or freischtz as it might be played
the murmur where the streamlet played
of housefamiliars stands dismayed
and hands atremble Nyanya prayed
while shes from top to toe surveyed
lensky has watched his rage has blazed
hes lost his selfcommand and crazed
the man she feared and idolized
among the guests she recognized
the lucky bard and as he dozed
a masculine disguise to aid
and put a crosssign on the maid
nor his who sings of Finlands maid
by nervous hands of a schoolmaid
and those we sing for will be paid
after the martyrs price it paid
was the first thing that Olga said
her eyes were opened and she said
then stepping nearer Eugene said
so my Zaretsky as i said
his awkwardness hes hardly said
stumblingly call to mind he did
but at the window in the splendid
this grandison of hers was splendid
two verses of the Aeneid
still tumbling devil snake and cupid
still in the porch exhaustedstupid
the bear let out a roar and held
on springtime grasses of the field
under the tables linen shield
from her monsieur took on the child
beyond the grave we all must build
he was sweetnatured and yet wild
boston and ombre for the old
the moderns rage against the old
my sweet my dearest heart Im old
times were when i was sharp and bold
had made his name when bold as bold
the ancients have gone stiff and cold
before their eyes they see unfold
with fire from every cross of gold
is he a Melmoth a Childe Harold
they praise the Father of the world
and now at last he saw the world
lawgiver to the modish world
we each have enemies in this world
ditties of our secret world
ditty of our secret world
in manifesting as he could
spying my features as he could
and been as happy as i could
of calculated slander should
already stirred him as they should
his illness lends him courage and
this russianized version of  the Greek Agatho  is  elephantine and
your zeus your Cypris your whole band
a flood on which no frosty band
until the grave by your strong hand
to the princess in his weak hand
now warmth and blossom are on hand
a lancer wooed and won her hand
have clearly got the upper hand
i leave the verdict in your hand
the letter from Tatyanas hand
for quite a while by fortunes hand
each grips his pistol in his hand
or letters in a young girls hand
had been imposed by winters hand
in untold beauty close at hand
i feel a small foot in my hand
put a strong staff into my hand
in front of you on every hand
more searching than Chateaubriand
sometimes in reveries sacred land
the spring invites you to the land
to save the honour of our land
and took a mortgage on his land
long lively tales from wonderland
of ruts that grace our fatherland
and blesses the unrivalled brand
with me to see an alien strand
hear my confession as i stand
and on their marks has made them stand
olga is there he sees her stand
you see your fated tempter stand
his father failed to understand
tanya begins to understand
perhaps her love could in the end
to see my kin and in the end
interior dcor in the end
a hidden beauty in the end
same Pom same husband to the end
a true companion to the end
he drained his glass down to the end
but you blest husbands to the end
and give her comfort to the end
goodbye for now we make an end
his acts and words to suit our end
we weep for the young lovers end
my fate it leads me to what end
to ask of you that you transcend
his choice could shock or might offend
you know im hard to comprehend
whoever you may be a friend
all right ill come then What a friend
but dont be cross my darling friend
bordeaux youre like a faithful friend
have reunited friend to friend
if youd still been with me dear friend
still has Monsieur Finemouche for friend
you kept your friendship with our friend
the poet struck down by his friend
by nature contradictions friend
boredom thats what so bad my friend
i dont know why but for my friend
hes here  Monsieur Guillot my friend
give me the homely hearth and lend
in grief that nothing else could mend
martin zadka fails to mend
on whom alone can we depend
my father blessed me So Id spend
whither does all my yearning tend
the horrid nightmare must portend
onegin wastes youd almost find
reverie hounds you and you find
he leaves a tender verse behind
his tea with rum quite left behind
in any picture of this kind
and useful goods of every kind
custom is despot of mankind
cold pure as ice and as unkind
your cold discourse were less unkind
someone towards whose heart and mind
unfathomable to the mind
with pots and basins out of mind
in deep anxiety of mind
can yet keep nailcare much in mind
rewards the music of your mind
that poison brew and in your mind
your tanyas image in your mind
caricatured them in his mind
she doesnt see or doesnt mind
to know you swooned and in a second
who in the princess for that second
evgeny echoed him My second
and also prettier ill be bound
get up its gone six ill be bound
pursue his love  and at one bound
it stirs her drooping soul to bound
she stopped at the loud torrents bound
though there hes no more to be found
a corpse on boards was all he found
was quite beyond his wit we found
at least her tone is sometimes found
what was it in your heart it found
of mind got clarity newfound
will reach and past the tombs compound
reader you ask and Ill expound
stood thunderstruck In what wild round
from million Street came floating round
to her glass porch pursues her round
ill make them spar another round
with thoughts of him in ceaseless round
the programme of his daily round
by dreary snowdrifts piled around
gazes at all the scene around
istmina thronged all around
and glittering whiteness all around
spread out its shadow all around
as it assembles them around
onegins waiting on the ground
let fall his pistol on the ground
hes left sad footprints on the ground
by naiads one foot on the ground
close as a shadow on the ground
perplexed and rooted to the ground
an offering ready for the ground
the pensive Dryads hidingground
and the poet without a sound
emotion thought and magic sound
and then a drozhkys clopping sound
his heart was plunged A sudden sound
more tender than it used to sound
hymns of the ages never sound
frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound
she hates a friendly voices sound
and listen for the hearts first sound
at noontime does his horn resound
the blood came smoking from the wound
with our poor girl was kind and good
honest devotion to the good
as gage of all things that were good
of leaves that autumn killed for good
she guards in silence and for good
and wrecked the flooringboards for good
and then she broods and mopes for good
bidding us to reject for good
regard and slipped away for good
farewell the games of golden childhood
commands our rhymesterbrotherhood
your presence aches and in my blood
your advent swamps me in its flood
fancy a wine serene in mood
with eugene frozen where he stood
below a hill a garden stood
theres not a word shes understood
a house a village and a wood
and trails alone around the wood
by the new whisper in the wood
buynovs heels have split the wood
he fell in love with darkest wildwood
if i like you had been a bard
perfervid language of the bard
which ovid sang for which the bard
out of the hand of that same bard
of gulnare he would play a card
but in the old days she had heard
how could she why hed never heard
came out so soft it scarce was heard
from the first moment it was heard
the sources chattering voice is heard
the tolerant Evgeny heard
or worse to a soire Unheard
and always the inspired regard
with puzzled and confused regard
on jam and speeches in regard
tatyana lowered her regard
and tears were drowning her regard
olgas no life in her regard
condemned to a lifetime of hard
as at a censure that was hard
in deepest thought at the chessboard
and dead ideas from that old hoard
eugene attends the boulevard
she entered the deserted yard
now nearer hooves and in the yard
to rains and flax and the stockyard
hes racing millward like a bird
he sends a second then a third
as yours did Homer godlike lord
but scarcely understood a word
she sat there through her teeth a word
acute and subtle  in a word
and pale and fade without a word
and looked at him without a word
i really dote upon the word
arrived apace he gives the word
no shes already pledged her word
to eugenes letter word for word
and there a tombstone says its word
and washed its face to her brought word
of trumpet dagger mask and sword
all that today we find absurd
and everything is cramped and loud
might have resounded long and loud
melpomene wails long and loud
as much as in Moscow the proud
my giddy mistress made me proud
while a mazurka holds the crowd
among my friends in all that crowd
before a cold indifferent crowd
long long ago no that could be
deserving object there can be
old uncles end was soon to be
but ours whatever he might be
im terrified  so let it be
to private tastes we each subscribe
the usurers voracious tribe
and brains and an attractive face
swam on the rivers dreaming face
into the alle face to face
of our first meeting face to face
the men confront them face to face
did any glasses seek her face
fresh as a poppyflower your face
caressing breath has fanned my face
play on the windows frosted lace
garden a modest home the place
but in his songs kept pride of place
a restless urge for change of place
the grand monde finds it out of place
still after many years in place
in our first ages from no place
had ruled out reading in their place
in rural calms most secret place
has made the park her broodingplace
from young Tatyanas dwellingplace
others prescribe a wateringplace
that with him to the trystingplace
when galloping at headlong pace
up the hillside at breakneck pace
to aim at steady even pace
sigh and stood up began to pace
too faint to stir a further pace
in through the door at swallows pace
she cant escape at any pace
has lately wintered just a space
each took four steps across the space
alone across the fields of space
she speeds her footsteps to a race
and opened Schiller but the embrace
a soul of sympathy and grace
though some support it with good grace
and then with an enchanting grace
they sit they cross themselves for grace
a few books had escaped disgrace
fortunate one hed not disgrace
horace
of instant thoughts a fleeting trace
your night of frettings left no trace
coquettishness has got no trace
the bitterness was mine  the ice
their joyous way across the ice
that though polite was clear as ice
would launch into selfsacrifice
hed pop the poison in his chalice
was his wed both drunk passions chalice
there waited for us both the malice
what traps hed set him with what malice
boytribes with skates on loudly slice
someone like you and me just nice
girls albums signed in blood for choice
encore Mona  and rejoice
conversing in a singsong voice
to know the audience hears his voice
to moscow settled in a trice
pure passions flame and in a trice
and ill be thirty in a trice
such good and sensible advice
at least ill give him some advice
can it be true it wont come twice
to the circle of our dance
to life and hope with just a glance
there was a softness in his glance
or else disturb my mournful trance
it brought back Tanya from her trance
of recompense beyond endurance
it fascinates by its assurance
gay nature and its sparkling distance
from any gentlemanly distance
a stall a kitchen and a fence
by flickering past us like a fence
and no ones ear could take offence
no boy to fight or take offence
for him at night before the indulgence
that there existed for the indulgence
spoilt by the habit of indulgence
with irresistible refulgence
raised a dull eye to moons refulgence
now dazzled by one things effulgence
an unknown yard she sees from thence
heres boredom madness or pretence
without romance or false insistence
more joy still when with mute insistence
as helpmeet in my sad existence
farewell to you my free existence
from his first youth hed known the force
and not without a sigh perforce
puts out the lamps the whole brigade
where every day a bloodstained shade
just now of wrestling with his shade
for him a lofty stair his shade
into the tombs mysterious shade
with mournful sound the secret shade
had come to him in field and glade
the days grew shorter in the glade
the coolness of the sombre glade
tanya is gripped No comments made
poetrys sacred frenzy made
they heap up silver with a spade
her progress at the masquerade
and in a singsong voice confide
the inmost thoughts that girls can hide
i love you whats the use to hide
and felt himself loves invalide
past the grand ladies see her glide
by two small oaktrees in a ride
ranges Lenoralike shed ride
beloved friend thou art my bride
for honour a straightforward pride
amongst the soulless men of pride
hes moved you see him from the side
she sits down calmly on one side
as did the general at her side
to help her from the other side
the new moon horned on her left side
friend of my heart be at my side
breakneck by moonlight at my side
to gentlemen on every side
since then my heart was wrenched aside
barrels and then to drive aside
thumps as the balls are pressed inside
perfidious blow to my inside
there gathered at the coffinside
feelings he valued  from outside
tatyana groaned above the tide
that i prefer to Champagnes tide
and now the door is opened wide
raised nose and shoulders high and wide
the fools who sparkle far and wide
of every funeral far and wide
tranquillity and solitude
set to wellknown childrens glee
with the wellMeaner on her knee
show me the sense Divine decree
sits imperturbable and free
who can combine it with the free
my tedious taste for feeling free
now sensitive and now carefree
at feasts was strong and fancyfree
on points that all long since agree
but youll undoubtedly agree
notes to chapter three
to drain on credit bottles three
each springtime on the growing tree
or else from far off he could see
yet dared not trust what i could see
the house the park Ill go and see
light dreams for new ones so we see
perhaps though Phoebus warns Ill see
onegin too  and there to see
kept asking shall I live to see
becomes a horse for all to see
at first with God knows whom to see
and put his glasses on to see
who loves you more than I lets see
i hear you say But can you see
now heres a letter as you see
the peaceful Muses devotee
and hate with malice he whose life
to be respected all through life
and daily scenes of modish life
yourself too long from social life
and ill be true to him for life
the climacteric of our life
and dutifully shared his life
the sad beginnings of his life
always contented with his life
had nothing to employ his life
far more than most who leave this life
august Lafontaine  German novelist of family life
how sad the scar of passions knife
where civil treacheries are rife
the lies that in the press run rife
thinking he loved me and in strife
just like a shadow or a wife
is yawned away with friends and wife
his children and his faithful wife
and with no post no work no wife
the war the snowfall and his wife
and with his dinner and his wife
but ive become anothers wife
are bound by every virtuous wife
but tell me who she is My wife
has found a port for his old age
as i recall a bygone age
goodlooking in the flower of age
when not quite eighteen years of age
all this at eighteen years of age
i was just thirteen years of age
faublas disciple for an age
who would have thought it What an age
that nubile maid of riper age
with demoiselles of riper age
not even in her earliest age
are entered here in friendships gage
and yet your honour is my gage
mountains are piled on every carriage
horses and coach are spliced in marriage
the solitude of woods and tillage
hes gone away and left his village
to ensure that till next time our image
that in the usual Christmas scrimmage
he sang of lifetimes yellowed page
shortened or lengthened off the page
i close I dread to read this page
or novelties from fashions page
the majors here hes all the rage
and lives a veritable sage
a poet and a Kantian sage
adorned the sanctum of our sage
as was the old suspicious sage
omens dismayed her with their presage
each object held a secret message
is seized by Tambovs poetsage
sit down how strange its like the stage
and yawn in silence at the stage
was younger still but at that stage
of wandering tribesmen while the ravage
of their society turned her savage
evgenys total store of knowledge
shall i depict with expert knowledge
where he was master of his college
where the prizeboy of fashions college
faces before him flash and change
but i refuse to chop or change
across the baltic in exchange
for wood and tallow all the range
at first she had no heart to range
the censors tribute Ill arrange
all who behold him find him strange
but then she found their choice was strange
his pup to grace the sledge while he
nothing more lovable than he
of loves anxiety Blessed is he
all in a blaze I said its he
forward or back its true that he
through baseness of the soul that he
was it to no effect that he
ours was no Grandison  not he
i know it all my secret ache
bright northern Cleopatra she
took her to his estate where she
then quietly at last says she
and obstinate his look But she
am doomed to perish yet to die
and in her grief seemed fit to die
death on his brow your friend should lie
rveillezvous belle endormie
that moment of a luscious pie
five versts or so from Krasnogrie
riding on the lugubrious prairie
that soul without a moral tie
moment the assembly seemed to shake
i roam by the secluded lake
a rambling walk beside my lake
and so in the salons could make
were placed across the gulf to make
to his mysterious tree the snake
exhausted and done up i take
that your proud glance is sure to take
for whats been given us to take
a tempting plume for you to take
bears gone a hallway no mistake
a flimsy bridge whose every quake
and shouts suggest a crowded wake
with the grand general in her wake
and every morning I awake
a pretty girl exactly like
and in a corner make him choke
tanyas no child  its past a joke
for satan loves a splendid joke
on tragedy but its no joke
will disappear as fast as smoke
relations off and never spoke
they took offence at this and broke
just at this crisis of his gale
shutters are up and all is pale
in question gossip news and tale
the leather rein to learn the tale
value the hero of my tale
but from the hero of my tale
with this the hero of my tale
in talk so fruitless and so stale
such crystalled scents as best are able
as far removed as they were able
what of them Tanya I was able
bewitches Tanya he is able
now that the British Muse is able
a skeleton jerked by a cable
years back to call up many a fable
prepared for prophecy and fable
a grammar a digest of fable
to wreck a maidens sleep with fable
that marble Ninas proved unable
the charge that poets are unable
piled books and through the pane the sable
and in the bathhouse had a table
a group of monsters round a table
two cupboards one divan a table
she sits with nina at a table
the iron figure on the table
put back the libel on the table
porcelain and bronzes on the table
for hours with elbows on the table
they needed kvas like air at table
oakfloored and simple as a stable
cookedup where garretvermin babble
who never learnt how dreamers babble
endorsed by fashionable rabble
with every different kind of rabble
who never scorned the social rabble
but therell be such a rout and scrabble
or cause the bursting of his bubble
when out to burst a rivals bubble
of jealousy to seem to tremble
and frames would shudder windows tremble
now things are changed now we resemble
how early hed learnt to dissemble
of sunlight makes it flash and crumble
a block of snow will slip and tumble
sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble
how early on he learnt to trouble
then in return for all this twaddle
from her they strive to coax and coddle
and dinner with a touch of idle
true scorn should punish and should bridle
a steed responsive to the bridle
tatyana had no dolls to dandle
bored by success giddy trifle
found that in laughter yawns could stifle
louder and louder sounds the wrangle
a carvingknife  and in the tangle
bursts with cold envy and with bile
his epigrams topped up with bile
not even by chance once in a while
he even dares once in a while
to crack between them for a while
the evening passes and meanwhile
and wasted lifes fine flower meanwhile
galop mazurka waltz meanwhile
and for a chuckle or a smile
a girl or two without a smile
his destiny without a smile
will the benighted reason smile
already tends too much to smile
emboldened by his Olgas smile
his virulence that made you smile
befitting such a noble pile
scarce out of bibs already fickle
fresh from the cot an infant pickle
he laughs  they all begin to chuckle
he nods  they start to fuss and truckle
when in the park in the alle
and all the works of Fontanelle
nasce una gente a cui l morir non dole
too pale too thin but on the whole
for happiness  that alien role
was far from happy with his role
foretells for her some wondrous role
how well shed studied her new role
the fleeting tenderness that stole
such frank tendresse away they stole
but god how deadly dull to sample
let others learn from his example
constantinople
of love so timorous and gentle
and set off prompter than a whistle
evgeny read the sad epistle
theres yap of pugs and laughs and bustle
the hall is full of noise and hustle
for dreams or journalistic battle
my husband for his wounds in battle
a vivid brush a witty rattle
would cause widespread remark and tattle
freed from its dripping cork the bottle
and glumly serves the medicine bottle
solemn too long compelled to throttle
and the sly baseness fit to throttle
dons of Epicurean rule
he read of course the sceptic Bayle
he killed eight years in such a style
that even so my wretched style
in sensible oldfashioned style
unnoticed in unseeing style
what have your wits to do with me
his sunday game of cards with me
and here my sentiments impel me
hm hm Distinguished reader tell me
young tanya first appeared to me
him prove it writing after me
allow no rest to you or me
he destined Olgas hand for me
whose memory will preserve for me
tatyanas rites are not for me
enough stand up Its now for me
ive no one here who comprehends me
and now a swooning mind attends me
an old man saw her as she came
the fields are dark since evening came
that there be just one voice which came
which neighbour dear My head became
was it for you that i became
long since unstirred by praise and fame
petrovsky Castle and the fame
earn for me the rewards of fame
and stately periwigs their fame
become a joke to us its game
to do them all is easy game
all modish foes dread worldly shame
to speak believe me of my shame
misunderstanding noise and blame
which i myself wont praise or blame
nothing you did gave cause for blame
and theirs was the poetic flame
of calm and reason when the flame
in languid silence or the flame
a novel graced with such a name
youd not so much as know the name
heroine of zhukovskys poem of the same name
rings proudly in that sombre name
straightened his wig and asked her name
as scarlet heels have lost their name
though menelaus in Helens name
of faraway Onegins name
and not a mention of my name
like a true friend to speak my name
set off the ladies like a frame
since im a member of the same
while men all sombre all the same
the hapless Phrygians all the same
freezes my blood Yet all the same
that fired his soul to burn the same
new depths of boredom No the same
of eloquence and just the same
now shes bereft and just the same
selfwilled it may be just the same
and part in kindness just the same
which one comes first Its just the same
peopled my sleep and to their theme
to pass the time was Eugenes theme
of the cotillions endless theme
onegin  now once more my theme
felicitously every theme
of listening like a judgesupreme
to institute a new regime
until brguets unsleeping chime
summits of aspen birch and lime
a brook flows through a grove of lime
in twilight of alles of lime
no beauties of a foreign clime
of something vague some misty clime
grew hardened to lifes frosty clime
she wont inhale the powdered rime
the horror of disgrace and crime
that stretched from Romulus in his prime
yet sweeter far at such a time
lets go where winding all the time
and at the very selfsame time
across the years to our own time
no noise of gaiety no time
in winter when for longer time
ill end my tale some other time
and manners of an earlier time
is out of fashion in our time
has found an end before his time
youthful who ripened in his time
where are the reveries this time
to where he came to her that time
he sang of grief and partingtime
advises him of dinnertime
for her no joy from wintertime
torment of pride And whys he come
from ball to bed behold him come
pointed each year for time to come
and with it forced renown to come
of its unvarnished monochrome
to me her best inquarto tome
she folds the page lays down the plume
on orders which of course presume
that thievish mouths cannot consume
with the pink glow the snows assume
the youthful votary of rhyme
i need to rest from all this rhyme
i own it tender Parnys rhyme
the girls sing out the ancient rhyme
loves melting dreams shall fill my rhyme
the strain of Tassos octaverhyme
our modern Russias plague and bane
to all thats trivial and inane
lively capricious and inane
tatyana breathed on the cold pane
ensconced beside the windowpane
his mother taps the windowpane
a hybrid cross of cat and crane
reader by painting you a scene
that king of the satiric scene
no brilliant truth no vivid scene
how long has he been on the scene
olgas appeared upon the scene
but to the garden to the scene
had once before across the scene
he knew too well that sort of scene
and nameless rivulet that scene
broke greetings off and gave eugene
zaretsky bit his lip eugene
and lensky follows her eugene
girls tears their swooning for eugene
no doubt about it its eugene
where tanya now confronts eugene
of whispering woods where my eugene
moved and surprised she stays serene
no paradise can stay serene
all point at her and all combine
and yet by Vergil or Racine
and wore his dressinggown to dine
vladimir lensky quick lets dine
clarissa Julie or Delphine
with three roan horses in a line
a novel on the established line
the youth of those past days in line
left her to follow her own line
may then amuse my glad decline
wont benefit these guts of mine
to bellow out shes mine shes mine
tatyana lonely heroine
youths choice the flower of French cuisine
sang for the guests above the wine
im much afraid that bilberry wine
a slipper or a magazine
one raves in verse like me and one
if youll turn back to chapter one
notes to chapter one
parisian taste invents for one
dogged by one feeling only one
in secret judgement what hed done
dreamt of reproving what theyd done
her soul was waiting for someone
with work at home but when hed gone
amazement Wheres your second gone
i do I do Well wheres he gone
eugene takes Olga and is gone
for unmeant kindness  how he shone
his gaze at Tatyana alone
daytimes and evenings passed alone
dumb I must perish and alone
i am in love leave me alone
all blend into eugene alone
a place for rest eugene alone
and where terpsichore alone
of the whole world her nurse alone
in deepest grasses quite alone
no tearstains nothing Wrath alone
to come back to the hall alone
the units are ourselves alone
that mediocre dress alone
as in the nook hed sit alone
where master used to sit alone
then id have looked for you alone
together they arrived and none
whisper repeated to the crone
and heres the hearth explains the crone
taken your place though not your throne
in a melodious flutelike tone
are coloured in a single tone
lend ears to my lugubrious tone
by blazing fireplace and intone
is graven on that face of stone
his song was limpid in its tune
of modish belles the modish foe
i can see naught as Hymens foe
to infuriate a clumsy foe
sings as he plaits a humble shoe
her darling foot of its wet shoe
a passerby and on tiptoe
from here deepsunk in pensive woe
consequences of hideous woe
when shall I start on my escape
its time to drop astern the shape
for men to see still in the scope
right in the flower of joyous hope
just let yourself be your whole care
and ease his catch with all due care
her fingers shake she doesnt dare
as loves technique when it would blare
its natural right to rave and flare
for vanity and din and glare
and grandison beyond compare
moscow has beauties and to spare
youth is a fever we must spare
monsieur lAbb the mediocre
folly for me to interfere
the countrys pretty stupid here
how bold or bashful there and here
and cattle roamed the plain and here
today he promised hed be here
closely embraced in wending here
with cause that Ive recalled them here
i keep them and will quote them here
pikhtn of the Hussars was here
he saw that as in cities here
beneath the stone reposes here
the bear explains my cousins here
is with dull trash that cant cohere
onegins soul encountered there
her drops of tears and seated there
with young Semynova and there
then suddenly shes off and there
who sets me snoring then and there
saint Petersburgs fine flower was there
his french valet Guillot is there
three pairs of handsome ones  yet there
unspeaking too but stretched out there
theres vacancies in plenty there
and wheres her sister now and where
from whom hed kept a letter where
and if she happened anywhere
the faces met with everywhere
pursue his pencil everywhere
its own perfection everywhere
to wreak by stirring Lenskys ire
of sighs and compliments and fire
secret sledgerides in verse of fire
onegin looks with eyes of fire
no feast no welcomegifts  with fire
doubts to exhaust the heart then fire
this soul that glowed with virgin fire
poetic dreams a brighter fire
and found her dreams her secret fire
no never in the hottest fire
we have to cherish and admire
hell take you prisoner youll admire
the idol that shell most admire
have each asked him to a soire
her youth with all his repertoire
is either the distrait Vampire
they dont deserve what they inspire
the best revenge one could desire
of boiling youth did i desire
is all those stubborn lips desire
the full fruit of her hearts desire
jealousys flame to light desire
nothing could alter or could tire
i could describe here his attire
nor crawled in suppliant attire
tatyana in lowcut attire
the heavenly lights in glorious quire
with all our hearts and who require
to hear what latest modes require
gentleman squire
whom shall we never find a bore
the highest circles are a bore
the season which is such a bore
of olga loves that kind of bore
could they not laugh out loud before
its image then to swoon before
theyd settled that some years before
their hands are dipped in scarlet gore
what its transported to our shore
of tales of girls and ghosts and lore
your words and in my soul to explore
is dressed undressed and dressed once more
then he began to talk once more
the deeper in the wood the more
is mincing manners  nothing more
of lenskys fate they said no more
since when is this Two years or more
selfportraits only  furthermore
abandon hope for evermore
i kept in mind an ancient store
you were the first ones he forswore
malfiltre
reflection was her friend and pleasure
from all sweet things that gave me pleasure
but now in this vindictive pleasure
on her smug face a flush of pleasure
i regularly take much pleasure
friends how my heart would leap with pleasure
by moonlight two young girls took pleasure
his converse gave Onegin pleasure
or servants waiting on her pleasure
thank you for sorrow and for pleasure
there any friend of harmless pleasure
but in misfortune or displeasure
with jealousy beyond all measure
and then to part us in full measure
the secret of her husbands measure
who is there who will truly measure
so it was not in any measure
thank you for all the gifts i treasure
whom then to credit Whom to treasure
when suddenly I saw this treasure
o flowers and love and rustic leisure
time was in evening hours of leisure
their table and their hours of leisure
she found in labours and in leisure
it touched with reverie her leisure
she calls down curses on their leisure
the place where Eugene loathed his leisure
ready to share our quiet leisure
he goes inside corpselike of feature
that meanwhile pinched and glum of feature
and so at last feature by feature
he was convinced a kindred creature
more thoroughly thank God the creature
the halls without a living creature
vasily Levshin  writer on gardening and agriculture
your matchlessness to seek to capture
from hour to hour a surer capture
the circumstances of his capture
its also true in battles rapture
his soul to a delicious rapture
your feet to pale and waste what rapture
and country stillness there the lyre
enough of my loquacious lyre
some vote a doctor for the case
his pistols laid them in their case
he has to bring the battlecase
then afterwards alone at ease
on stage are thumping without cease
impart such lessons as you please
no longer does the herdsman chase
and portents of the lunar phase
tanya thanks each one with a phrase
her outoffashion turns of phrase
sits with Limburgs vivacious cheese
yet how I wish that I might raise
for which he must receive due praise
with heart thats grown unused to praise
who all his life would garner praise
i never lived or wrote for praise
by sighs of passion or by praise
gentlemanly quite precise
his mind so cold and so precise
forty years long would criticise
for she was bored by laughs and noise
for tempests and for feasts and noise
and he was bored with social noise
have vanished like an empty noise
smiles and a maidens tranquil poise
my declaration may give rise
the morning after a surprise
ambassador In some surprise
or with an epigramsurprise
no matter hope in childs disguise
at such vivacious free good sense
and mileposts grip the idle sense
the man of honour and of sense
here theres no conscience here no sense
was his absorption in their sense
wheres the high aim the ardent sense
of youth so tender so intense
purport of other lines intense
command me darling as you choose
and every night shares her repose
thats when Ill sit down to compose
has hardly mastered postal prose
far from it just one more collapse
the alle to the lake the copse
when we begin to talk of verse
prepares himself and then his verse
of ranks and ages so diverse
of oligarchical converse
come to the fields my friends To horse
he leaves the house calls for his horse
the horses fidget worse and worse
compact of amorous trash and worse
even in our names and how much worse
the coachmen ring the fire and curse
sets out upon her homeward course
its winds had blown him far off course
and magic nights In headlong course
so cursing womens devious course
by the cold worlds corrupt finesse
were all the law that I would use
elle tait fille elle tait amoureuse
but nurse you see Oh dont refuse
i introduced my saucy muse
within her bosom to abate
friends all this meant was Ive a date
to pranks and jokes of earlier date
for you have at this early date
fresh leaves for such is heavens mandate
from cruel fortune such a fate
you help him to an honoured fate
would on those evenings guess the fate
he would have found a normal fate
resigned disposal of your fate
the entire story of your fate
the toll of those borne off by fate
would be allied to him by fate
youll never leave me to my fate
and i surrender to my fate
the pillars of the turnpikegate
leave far behind that citygate
looked down in an access of hate
is tinsel on a life i hate
sooner or later will relate
a vulgar touch I cant translate
for swapping bullets with my mate
by calmly aiming at his pate
hed see his soul cool in its grate
in loaded carriages migrate
to fashions absolute dictate
of pity for my wretched state
he saw the sad girls trembling state
but so it is Im in no state
my house my evenings all that state
maidservants from the whole estate
what trifling could be more complete
of plains where boredom reigns complete
drew scrutiny no less complete
lest in forgetfulness complete
where her securitys complete
here a weak version incomplete
the murmuring Nereids recite
that im just longing to indite
roofs flowerbeds fences all in white
a patriot a cosmopolite
coated with a thin layer of spite
scarcely recalled their love their spite
proficiency to speak and write
but madrigals Ive got to write
and put them on a pacedout site
a greyhaired perfumed exquisite
with any torture so exquisite
bigot or prude or has he quite
beside unfinished lines a suite
enough ive wandered in the suite
he stalked the drawingrooms remote
and in her unconsidered note
see chapter Three note
written in Bessarabia pushkins note
written at Odessa pushkins note
wellknown restaurateur pushkins note
thats the morass I beg you note
still filled with Eugene Tanya wrote
from bostons cloth or gossips quote
him far enough through wild and waste
yes focus on them your lorgnette
and every minute his lorgnette
and an insouciant lorgnette
and under toute  vous Annette
their unattractive ttette
and set on hating the coquette
beneath a brook rolls its tribute
one pair I pay them memorys tribute
that all of Russia cant contribute
to the first meanings of his flute
stood in the door cherubic mute
inside the Larins house fell mute
come in and warm yourself a minute
could i accept for just a minute
but now it bores me every minute
an inn at each stage of the route
slave of the service was en route
reflection or provoked dispute
godfearing folk will institute
on billiardtable rests a cue
youve paid insanity its due
our vessels long been overdue
her journey home is overdue
already high in treasons league
already studying to intrigue
unhesitating from her tongue
your early life unlock your tongue
to cool my glances and my tongue
now hear the friends in dialogue
and stoves with tiles of various hue
the sky is brilliant in its blue
is this the riddles missing clue
of a provincial ingnue
now to my cost it may be true
am always glad to write its true
ourselves on our landfall its true
a sorry state of things its true
what wings our first successes gave
who early died as die the brave
as he descended to the grave
this is vladimir Lenskys grave
see note  to chapter five
notes to chapter five
therell be a fight For that i give
promptly had nothing left to give
this very day Id gladly give
is this then what you cant forgive
the glare the fumes in which i live
such feckless passion  as i live
my word no welshing as i live
had only debts on which to live
in her once more has come alive
relined and strengthened for the drive
but youthful virgin hearts derive
whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive
like fields in spring when storms arrive
at last the final hours arrive
why fight whats known to be decisive
a man whos active and incisive
not cold but also not effusive
she was unhurried unobtrusive
bestirred himself was devilish active
he found tatyana so attractive
what can one do as said above
had chased me to the world above
in ink with colourwash above
youre all in fever heavens above
vexation vainness heavens above
a lyre and on it perched a dove
revive it with another shove
it cant be youths distemper  love
frightened to death a timid love
slavonic god of love
ages wed never heard of love
nurse Im not ill I Im in love
until this day a ladys love
recalling earlier loves did we
has wished it an abrupt goodbye
penates came to cast an eye
men made their bows and sought her eye
not only by Evgenys eye
what ails him hes in some strange daze
to meet his thirsty lips What daze
to heart And in his misted gaze
arrives the girls exhausted gaze
parade before their mocking gaze
of tears will cloud her tender gaze
tanya pursued them with her gaze
with years no more to meet our gaze
watch for your smile and catch your gaze
homestead before her parents gaze
looks at him with a steady gaze
has fixed on her a steady gaze
the simple legend  then a haze
we were swept off in reveries haze
down slopes of mountains when a blaze
his head upon her shoulder blaze
has kept him warm in chimneys blaze
more and more brightly still they blaze
her eyes are lowered but ablaze
apartment where a double glaze
and all into the salon squeeze
and taken by the French  some prize
with eugene proved a tempting prize
each moral puts us in a doze
the ploughman there delights to doze
as i have learn from my belief
of morpheus had induced relief
or pining Olgas hours were brief
she once had pined in girlish grief
that inexperience leads to grief
his sweetheart faithful to her grief
yet truthfully and not in chaff
upon the side of the distaff
their cloaks Zaretskys measured off
at cleopatra hiss her off
serfs chosen as recruits for the army had their forelock cut off
wholl clap an entrechat or scoff
and now the two opponents doff
in a peaked cap all dust and fluff
and in flat calm Ive found the stuff
now even Didelots tedious stuff
and took two Petriads in calf
he charged three roubles and a half
that was less clever still by half
he never took one from the shelf
and leant upon the granite shelf
odd volumes from the devils shelf
could see no harm in books himself
just as the Poet paints himself
is forced to crucify himself
a mocking  reference to Mikhail  Muravievs poem To the Goddess of
where in the heart of silence rang
of many distant lands he sang
the bliss that fills me when your throbbing
a suite of elegies that throbbing
how heavy and how near to sobbing
so you inspired Yazkov sobbing
each news of her hed been imbibing
his style breathed love and not the gibing
had fortune blest me by prescribing
could i be happy circumscribing
all was material for transcribing
no madrigals were for inscribing
to his tatyana yes hes racing
it melts away it rushes racing
tatyana looks with pulses racing
a sharpnailed paw towards her bracing
above the water started tracing
beyond a doubt its wondrous tracing
he sweetened up with fancys icing
its furrow through the powdery icing
a saucy kibtka is slicing
was still mysterious and enticing
now hes returned what roles he dancing
behind her followed wildly dancing
still as he was has he stopped prancing
bacchantelike her flighty prancing
in summertime  for he was leading
and paris too But hear my pleading
what happened Though his eyes were reading
be good enough to go on reading
dressed like   duly dreading
the barbs that envys always spreading
still hardly opened up from fading
he mounts the sledge with daylight fading
whats in them All this loud parading
and all this flashy masquerading
that poisonous worm despised degrading
a hermits life  hed be proceeding
its over Supper is proceeding
each one by now is badly needing
desires and dreams and griefs were breeding
his collar in its beaver braiding
of solitude and peace abiding
and in it boldly Im confiding
he stoops and tenderly confiding
he steers her nonchalantly gliding
is death not pain So gently gliding
for shame and fear my wits are sliding
theyre settled in and crawling sliding
vladimir drops hand softly sliding
each in tumultuous turn descending
on the seashore with storm impending
whatever for caprice of spending
ingenious London has been sending
what of it nothing Im just sending
but inside brackets Im contending
and there loves protestations binding
there youre entirely sure of finding
that halfpay archivist and bounding
no i was born for peace abounding
the peasants there have wealth abounding
listless impatient for the pounding
petushkvs nails and spurs are sounding
in goods and fame But the sadsounding
has voices that are more resounding
they sing unmoved by their sweetsounding
her husband enters thus concluding
he and Onegin start alluding
tanya profoundly Russian being
or simply bow within her being
the utter virtue of their being
in the expression of its being
shocked by their modish pride and fleeing
in russian winters thrilled at seeing
but piteous he the allforeseeing
a word or two or stare unseeing
stare hard at her before exchanging
in swarms around Tatyana ranging
bottles to which some pitch is clinging
his beasts outdoors at dawn nor ringing
alas too salted now theyre bringing
shes turned up in my garden bringing
while in the hut a girl is singing
she loved the steppeland and its singing
came distant horns and gallant singing
and then a boat with oars aswinging
its echoes its belated urging
its wayward tricks its violent surging
outside the house But youll be aching
the hour was late And now from aching
to whom in a fine flow of preaching
he had conveyed some moral teaching
was stripped away and mists encroaching
their southward flight one saw approaching
and iron bridges will go arching
audacious tunnels will be marching
theyve missed Eugenes completed etching
but she who modelled for the sketching
that queen of secrets and of sighing
inspires your lute to sounds of sighing
now tanyas groaning now shes sighing
darent look behind her fairly dashing
our troikas effortlessly dashing
and now monotonously dashing
then our Automedons are flashing
with spinning noise and senseless flashing
breaking the lilac bushes smashing
the shepherd sings of Volgas fishing
below it when sprang rains are swishing
and for her cheeks to cease their blushing
but wildly still her heart is rushing
not so No sirs the odes the thing
all a pure maidens love was breathing
elbow on table spirit seething
for such am I When you were speaking
and whats your name she asks him speaking
the foes coldblooded and unspeaking
affected pose  and an unspeaking
it was quite torn in half and breaking
after your drive its quite backbreaking
only the pallor of heartbreaking
a farflung traveller who was creaking
is sad old moons Hark snow is creaking
tatyana flushed and started shaking
council and with profound headshaking
and growing thicker then heartshaking
night of the second started flaking
his life till dawns already making
neighbours in whispered tones are taking
the mail explains the time hes taking
over the business of leavetaking
a scream rings out the cabins quaking
then after midday hell be waking
next day Tatyana early waking
and your alasing and alacking
oh quit your stale your tedious quacking
is this the man that you were seeking
now march And calmly not yet seeking
she looks forgotten past all chalking
the merchants up the cabmans walking
a riding whip Tanya keeps walking
maiden in this superb unthinking
spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking
incendiary looks are slinking
would have divined the tender shrinking
straight up the chimney pipes were smoking
such is the usual country cooking
vladimir wealthy and goodlooking
the hearth was low beyond all stoking
towards his stall the pedlars hawking
but its the talent for concealing
that artless and without concealing
behind deceit or doubledealing
the storm is over dawn is paling
fancies once more are hotly bubbling
as if beneath her dark and rumbling
chairs are pushed outward loudly rumbling
through him is sweetness self In grumbling
as from their luscious hive go tumbling
once more that touch is fiercely troubling
i know your heart it has a feeling
her love obeys the laws of feeling
allows her hand thats lost all feeling
hate love joy sorrow  every feeling
tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling
why tanya what Alls dull and trifling
i cant sleep nyanya its so stifling
my dearest heart youre sick and ailing
calls out his name All unavailing
i am in love tatyanas wailing
just sentries to each other calling
is calling us for ever calling
when night patrols a perilous calling
our mother Eve were never falling
amongst devout coquettes appalling
silence was everywhere enthralling
urbane betrayals and the chilling
he struggled to bite back the chilling
all of an emptiness so killing
tribute of tears applauses shrilling
to eugene all was new and thrilling
there zerov shared the unwilling
sets a sonorous cadence rolling
now ten has struck his wheels are rolling
gossip and tricks and the patrolling
and there at large he goes patrolling
then night comes on the moons patrolling
meanwhile attired for morning strolling
once more he counts the hourbells tolling
whos not disgusted by cajoling
no early on his heart was cooling
its easy without too much fooling
we all meandered through our schooling
no not for long were belles the ruling
to roar of banquets din of brawling
lickspittles who adore their crawling
the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming
in quilted coat where rays were gleaming
stirred at your gaze so strange so gleaming
one customary object gleaming
but now theyre near Already gleaming
how proudly how divinely gleaming
a fishers fire Through country gleaming
believes in her elected dreaming
how sensuously her eyes are dreaming
embodied by the power of dreaming
she dreamt of portents in her dreaming
silver with moonlight in her dreaming
perpetually one goal for dreaming
he lay quite still and strange as dreaming
and everything around was dreaming
youd made appearance in my dreaming
respect and mercy for my dreaming
shot through below the chest  and streaming
through gloom and mist and there came streaming
more wine he calls to drench the flaming
before a fire too slowly flaming
have snorted reared and whitely foaming
started a life of pointless roaming
these figures from the world of seeming
what power enslaves you with your seeming
why is Tatyana guiltierseeming
meanwhile the local Cyclops aiming
magic of sleep had started claiming
when brguets chime is heard proclaiming
and wakened Lensky by exclaiming
and duck get up with instant timing
of gossip and set comment humming
his news has set the party humming
to drop all that oldfashioned mumming
she trembles and with fever drumming
meanwhile the news of Eugene coming
the regimental band is coming
awaits him  hears nobody coming
a different mask is he becoming
the frozen corpse drives off and homing
as all things did to bore him homing
i see another problem looming
of innocence a lily blooming
he could have spoken without harming
he should have settled for disarming
i must translate  theres no presuming
away inside that unassuming
when utterly worn out by rhyming
she holds a letter up and leaning
and on my bedhead gently leaning
that strikes him with such force and meaning
with love and comfort in your meaning
girl in Zhukovskys  poem who practises divination  with frightening
and all grandmothers who are listening
just yesterday And since your christening
my thoughtless pen has stopped designing
the morning star will soon be shining
and all the while the moon was shining
but i perhaps will be declining
and with its feeble glow outlining
i write my heart has ceased its pining
among the guests a general dinning
his visitor from the beginning
he takes her to a chair beginning
and now theres gradually beginning
theyre on the dancefloor waltzing spinning
zaretsky watched and stood there grinning
and so before the world of learning
if tanyad had the chance of learning
hed brought back all the fruits of learning
devoted to the Muse or learning
the thirst for work the lust for learning
this work of the profoundest learning
but finally she heaved a yearning
you drink the magic draught of yearning
and where is loves tempestuous yearning
earths rim grows light and a forewarning
the herdsmans horn proclaimed the morning
the occupations of the morning
into the fields surveys the morning
pinker than glow of Northern morning
whisper of breeze announces morning
would settle on the morrow morning
if only Lenskyd known the burning
are we recalled to grief still burning
on an old aunt whos long been burning
your curiosity is burning
a spirit strange a spirit burning
a mansion stands just round a turning
she walked but just as she was turning
one day came down that lonely turning
shelter for trysts at every turning
or unconsoled by the returning
no years of absence past returning
comes clearer through the mists of dawning
outside the scarlet rays of dawning
risen with earliest rays of dawning
no vision of her fields is dawning
for which of them the tomb was yawning
tell me whats your companion doing
the level tenor of his going
olgas adorer comes awooing
he sees in slush stretched out and keeping
of one sole thought holds him in keeping
alas for him there was no keeping
the shades of night within their keeping
youre ill God have you in his keeping
into a modish tyrants keeping
he consecrated to my keeping
with lines to mark where they were sleeping
and stops his doleful heart from sleeping
as if shed been profoundly sleeping
motionless as one soundly sleeping
is softly indolently sleeping
her sacred store of bliss and weeping
on my untimely urn be weeping
tatyana dear with you Im weeping
im near to sobbing near to weeping
poor lensky set aside for weeping
one wallows in delicious weeping
there too he honoured hotly weeping
hunts cheeky flies with swatter sweeping
still coughing hissing clapping champing
the audience still is busy stamping
or in your lonely homestead moping
from off her charming shoulders drooping
his weary head and softly drooping
at last with dawn upon him stooping
and sideways her poor head is stooping
up your accounts and raging toping
triquet sings out of tune Loud clapping
ignores approvals friendly clapping
and where thalia gently napping
great bard despite his modest trapping
her golden earrings off and whipping
now powders greyish stream is slipping
already olgas hand was gripping
into the pan Securely gripping
and now the crunchy snow is stripping
the urn of perfumed tea and tipping
but while she roams in thought not caring
and though to do so would be daring
so down came Tanya hardly daring
a general of majestic bearing
he finds the shock beyond all bearing
the clink of rowels met his hearing
before you on the ground unhearing
nor from the bathhouse roof be clearing
if motionless no life appearing
tatyanas husband now appearing
petushkv local Paris tearing
its my profession he was wearing
for grumbling gossiping and swearing
elated by the musics blaring
one melancholy fop declaring
scarlet with passions instant flaring
all sleep from the saloon a roaring
heres tea that Olgas been preparing
that shes ideal begins preparing
set off our troubled mind comparing
or else does nature fresh and staring
her bosom heaves her cheeks are staring
to draw a breath around her staring
only from Tanyas heart no cheering
and gallops Pistols made for pairing
beside his heavier half is snoring
cows low in the still nights of spring
some splendid lady is referring
deep down an epigram is stirring
the old dame had no thought of scouring
thats the refrain that you should sing
the nightingales begun to sing
so like Childe Harold glum unpleasing
no glance so sweet no sigh so teasing
in all its mystery Hymens teasing
log cabin a pretentiousteasing
over the slush where is he chasing
by now the rays of spring are chasing
gripped him no more soon they were raising
i dread your stern regard surmising
a calculation past despising
her worth but anathematising
once more he turned to books unchoosing
they kill the zest of rhymed composing
the years incline to gloom and prosing
a great attraction to conversing
to his disputing and his cursing
and eatables beyond all classing
of any Brguet and in passing
and while with all despatch hes dressing
new guest is gradually progressing
admires the tumult and the pressing
the unworthy husband through depressing
he warns his man for duty stressing
what in the world is more distressing
i longed like every breaker hissing
to smother her dear feet with kissing
but ladies hands are not for kissing
the mans a boor his brain is missing
to meet a black monk or if crossing
would leave her dithering and tossing
moscow how many strains are fusing
that fiery souls headstrong enthusing
everythings dim and unenthusing
how often would I fall to musing
appears offensive or amusing
even the scandals not amusing
while petersburgs already rousing
or if himself with rage arousing
some nonsense thrown up while carousing
manzoni and Chamfort perusing
and eugene halfawake halfdrowsing
shes dressed since dawn dead pale debating
shes nearly swooned shes suffocating
mushrooms in brine for winter eating
meantime shed give the maids a beating
loves frantic torments went on beating
in you a tender pulse was beating
well keep loves price appreciating
the house is packed out scintillating
hes flown to Talons calculating
hurrah lets start congratulating
by virtue of procrastinating
he wakes a bath where ice is floating
reader we must be separating
from violent passions fast pulsating
while lenskyd long been meditating
and thus our race so fluctuating
there came a murmur for a fleeting
evgeny ah Tatyana fleeting
light as a shadow shuns a meeting
i noticed once at our chance meeting
then what resulted from the meeting
for cousins from afar on meeting
what came from this unlookedfor meeting
smiling through sleep nature is meeting
about one thing till our next meeting
the infant year with cheerful greeting
on visits to us and in greeting
that lady the hostess was greeting
there never fails a kindly greeting
a story that still wants completing
hours pass no answer waiting waiting
the gallery claps  its bored with waiting
we too shall find our hour is waiting
that there his friend Kavrins waiting
zaretsky engineerinwaiting
flows and reverberates Reciting
vladimir shuts the book for writing
three whole hours at the least accounting
giddy as Venus when shes mounting
childeHaroldlike Eugenes devoting
untouched by envys bitter smarting
weltered in tears and sorely smarting
he who has cooled down love with parting
as if before some mournful parting
the old dame wept her daughters parting
she saw no friendly figure starting
the horse gets wind of them and snorting
sets the wise traveller cavorting
that point I wouldnt mind contesting
the elegys just vain protesting
and though perhaps old fires were thrusting
a soul so innocent so trusting
theyre plunging whirling all but squatting
at last alone and quite forgetting
on such indifference such forgetting
time races and shes been forgetting
only the estate provides a setting
can she have found the enigmas setting
then in the studys quiet setting
his spindly shaggy nag As fitting
her eyes along the margin flitting
just facing Tanyas where theyre sitting
the bearded outrider is sitting
she lowers darkened eyes unwitting
declares itself in ways unwitting
theres crashing rumbling pounding trotting
he had the talent of saluting
accounts were done a winter outing
while serious topics were disputing
that from the backdoor hed be leaving
ill stop that tempter from depraving
he murmurs Olgas mine for saving
and all is lost beyond retrieving
lies bright and vast beyond perceiving
at first they called but on perceiving
the north wind blows the clouds are driving
since dawn whole families have been driving
evgeny waits and here comes driving
already now the talk was thriving
tell me our neighbours are they thriving
towards the larins and arriving
she dropped Its he Eugene arriving
they laugh The guests begin arriving
then country evening fast arriving
now golden autumns just arriving
your dashing one is she surviving
of hope is somehow still surviving
with combs and steel utensils serving
as files and scissors straight and curving
the answers past all human viewing
what fate is my tomorrow brewing
and when its waters were not showing
and band already tired of blowing
roses romantically blowing
his sobs where his live tears were flowing
the sky breathed autumn time was flowing
and warmed the Chinese teapot flowing
and entered Ballroom overflowing
day faded on the table glowing
and good old sun more seldom glowing
how often when the sky was glowing
four fateful stairs Then without slowing
may spend a century in flaying
and tell of childrens plighted playing
once with its foaming and its playing
bubbles like Hippocrene are spraying
there was a pinebranch downward straying
ill catalogue each simple saying
its new to us beyond gainsaying
no one will think that worth gainsaying
time was when mornings breeze was swaying
will in my soul be hushed and dying
uncle in bed and near to dying
no time to pick it up  shes dying
so went his sermon Almost dying
and yet although its past conveying
and some were even testifying
and captive girls by Salgir lying
but hes mistaken Eugenes lying
in fact one day a note came flying
by now the shades of night are flying
to lift her skirt up still shes flying
through heavens expanse serenely flying
dead ash sets no more sparks aflying
two weeks the matchmaker was plying
by mist of tears without replying
yes in that springtime in lowlying
soon infidelity proved cloying
else having found his pleasure cloying
hope sting it then well try deploying
and friends and friendship souldestroying
secluded vales where swans were crying
my hours in fear and bitter crying
the rosy sealingwafers drying
that modish rings were still abuying
and radiate a rainbow blazing
shadows that flit behind the glazing
the third day wood and hill and grazing
neighbours in high content are wheezing
the banquets given no cause for sneezing
inns dont exist but in a freezing
at heart by grim remorses freezing
the pain the grief the marrowfreezing
giving his pistolbutt a squeezing
and where the husband recognizing
satiric poem by Ivan Dimitriev  The reference is  summarizing
shows freedoms advocate that strong
such rustic cunning cant be wrong
champion of rights as in the wrong
so long as theyre employed in song
were you in love when you were young
our native speech had never sprung
to talk as if with heart unwrung
of time between the wolf and dog
the sober head detesting each
the young hostess towards whom each
your heart some selfrestraint for each
so sketchily possessed by each
youll love again but you must teach
his dull sick look his dumb reproach
i hear the wrath of your reproach
in my petition an approach
his humbly suppliant approach
the flickering tones of dress and speech
is it not true that Russian speech
and take due warning from my speech
human reaction every speech
now pay attention I beseech
russian poet and translator from the french
the russian n like N in french
soon all that went without a wrench
so that all three went off to lunch
with lies and jokes that packed a punch
set the guests smiling at his arch
petrarch
the tongue of love and of Petrarch
with foppery and too much starch
was asked around as quite a catch
you wont find that quite so much catch
and all the neighbours planned a match
but when youve managed his despatch
a dog with horns a goateed witch
a rooster head and on the twitch
i love my Tatyana too much
no vulgar epigram too much
both set him yawning just as much
once i too liked it very much
a portrait with a charming touch
held in constraint by pitys touch
a modish taste a dowdy touch
theres no absurdity as such
along the neva in a sleigh
summons his people On the sleigh
breaks a new passage with his sleigh
impatient hatred flaming high
my africa where waves break high
customs bestowed us from on high
and offer to that ash a sigh
were picking berries from the bough
the bloom has withered on the bough
choked up Theres no wreath on the bough
the poets dead already though
he turns away Ive had enough
youll recognize him soon enough
of perfect bliss in you enough
with deep emotion through and through
so pure so spotless through and through
sbogar mysterious through and through
and scorned his fellows through and through
allows no comfort to come through
who in the dark came flashing through
and sighs and asks oneself all through
and arm in arm they all go through
in triumph youll see winter through
hed drink his coffee flutter through
and to tanya when he was through
crossed to the window read it through
is finished and Ive looked it through
i count each hour the whole day through
he eyes the door looks slyly through
the meaning of an epigraph
lensky composed in autograph
a madrigal for epitaph
the driver sits and cuts a dash
who taught her all this mad slapdash
but by and large their talks a hash
heartfelt imploring touching trash
of the most harmless hopeless trash
in sheepskin coat with scarlet sash
wait Ill present you  but you banish
just there is talking to the Spanish
but first the dreams that hope can cherish
dear tanya youre condemned to perish
theres nothing can employ her anguish
tatyana hunted by loves anguish
hes got consumption In his anguish
poor tanyas bloom begins to languish
meanwhile onegin starts to languish
suddenly lowering eyes that languish
her thoughts away knew how to lavish
another had the skill to ravish
fades from the view and in the hush
its due oblivion in the hush
of waiting for the dawn to blush
his neighbour entered at a rush
accounts shaved forelocks Sunday bath
towards the simple urn beneath
over it a mysterious wreath
fieldwork directed from the path
paved roads will traverse Russias length
and he pursuing till at length
and raven curls of shoulderlength
an eloquence of fevered strength
bringing her unity and strength
she flies no more shes lost her strength
jean lepage Parisian gunsmith
god grant them years and years of health
wont even cross their minds by stealth
of neighbouring owners of the earth
a seedling fallen in the earth
so fires of spring will bring to birth
there once I too strolled back and forth
the abstracted poet would bring forth
fragments of poems from the north
but im allergic to the north
only to Eugene showed their worth
but here we must control our mouth
parodies winter in the south
take leave of my lightheaded youth
a friend of yours in his first youth
nanny companion of my youth
my noon is here and thats the truth
your pride some answer or in truth
fancies my rhythmic search for truth
a gulf has gaped Says Tanya i
id not have known you therefore i
and with my Eugene so have i
its time she went But what can i
the poets only theme is i
all in good time on each point i
in stead of happiness say i

verdicts of vanity the bleak
of travellers tedium at its peak
so much Im left no time to speak
but all concurred that truth to speak
none listens when the others speak
i might have seen you heard you speak
is agony if I may speak
mens thoughts their plots the words they speak
he was a menace and a freak
to pass for an affected freak
does he still pose and play the freak
all shout and argue laugh and squeak
says the old lady in a croak
a crayfish rides on spiderback
the other jugs of applejack
in taffeta of mourning black
by dint of cuff and kick and smack
fruit liqueurs and an Almanack
they managed to disperse the pack
and swaggers in a red calpack
and hid the bookshelfs dusty stack
lenskys thrown down The murk is thick
avert his chest from pistols click
and never played a shrewder trick
lest he should by some clever trick
but when past joking he fell sick
eugene has caught up quick as quick
vesper is met by crow of cock
the branches of the oak with flock
and sleeping sounder than a rock
across the fields round hill and rock
and finally be turned to rock
but pantaloons waistcoat and frock
these words are not of Russian stock

already shed assume illluck

behind the mill In solemn talk
ill just remark my verses talk
replies We might as well They walk
and riches and the wish to thank
were served in order of their rank
i move in the grand monde that rank
their guests for all they ate and drank
fruits of my labour and my ink
she peers discreetly through a chink
but meanwhile let him live and think
where you were born as well i think
ladies of such a cast i think
parting with Olga made him think
at hours which why I cannot think
and sees whatever do you think
and bred upon the nevas brink
you too have seen on nevas brink
so now be off to nevas brink
parterres she runs to rivulets brink
in stars upon the riverbrink
the enjoyment of a friendly drink
the heart inside him seemed to shrink
first flakes of snow whirl round and sink
even without me it will sink
to gasp and on a bench to sink
like delvig when hes dining drunk
he sounds in lyric frenzy sunk
in morning time hed read a book
terse words or crosses in the book
god grant that from this little book
at any other sort of book
and in her hand a small French book
by lensky in his Olgas book
in fathers or old uncles book
at the academic Dictionbook
more closely at the grammarbook
or else a querys wondering hook
with lively and pellucid look
tatyana had a changeling look
though years ago I used to look
had left the squire no time to look
sad meditations in her look
heeding the press will make us look
or else my friend how does it look
and to that far and lonely nook
was an enchanting country nook
and just here in the windownook
deep in distraction his own rook
his elegies flow like a brook
by ancient limes or by a brook
where flows a little glittering brook
then lensky moved his pawn and took
coldness of wit each note he took
would bless the form his fortune took
you called there twice and since then took
in her own home She never took
for hearts delight or fun you took
blessed are daytimes care and cark
blest is the advent of the dark
tatyana sleepless in the dark
from her my lips will learn and mark
a mild rebuke was his worst mark
makes to her nurse lowvoiced remark
and then a stroll in Letny park
amateur of caprice and quirk
as much of banquets and the cork
in this fifth chapter of my work
muse of the epic bless my work
let no more such digressions lurk
you made me drunk as one could ask
with draughts from loves enticing flask
shed never tell them news or scandal
over the modish word ideal
goodbye to you my true ideal
the mountain maiden my ideal
the cooks prepare the midday meal
used in times past to ring a peal
he dozed away but when the real
and yet so light All that is real
and coachmen swear and women squeal
my carefree song would thus reveal
heroine of ozerovs tragedy Fingal
a novel vague and superficial
over his neighbours plain memorial
lensky restored to his manorial
two sisters whod received the initial
but lets return to our essential
it had its epigrampotential
of others thought  a splendid goal
be doomed to feel it theres one goal
his thoughts were on a distant goal
his strasbourg pie or point a moral
but he could draw a joking moral
so heartless and so detrimental
and to the vision of those mortal
to bring across Lepages mortal
she cant evgenys pushed the portal
by now the sledge is at the portal
delphine by Madame de stal
i find myself no longer equal
where can we find your equal
then from the Muse there came revival
my soul in secret gave survival
and still exempted from removal
though long since Eugenes disapproval
the subtle spouse was just as loyal
and the majestic antlered royal
while floors would split from crash of heel
or cunningly create a quarrel
and though he liked a fiery quarrel
and volume three of Marmontel
had killed his best friend in a duel
lensky resolved before the duel
still blazing with resentments fuel
to as vintage in the sequel
was finding leisures vacuum cruel
and sink to proses humble level
no hope no hope He leaves the revel
like passions dream that other revel
now faced with this enormous revel
he whirls her through the wood a hovel
but how she jumped when in this hovel
who else  the hero of our novel
shows up through trees all of a grovel
we visit them or without fail
dear ladies feet fly past like hail
its time and freedom hears my hail
send them good wishes through the mail
let me acquaint you on the nail
to face him now I feel too frail
and on their captivating trail
i signal to each passing sail
and still within behind the veil
lift up the gauzes of her veil
on foot by seven oclock until
sed alia tempora the devil
wishes his madness to the devil
installed in me a different devil
hed got annoyed the tricky devil
beds are made up the guests are all
i know it in the thoughts of all
the art hed studied best of all
of husbands friendship  worst of all
tatyana asked The children all
sentiment notebook verses all
maidens pretty maidens all
the lord have mercy on us all
onegin has outrun us all
it seems that he forgot us all
relations noone else at all
wed better hasten to the ball
and in full brilliance shines the ball
on dancefloor at breakup of ball
direct from shipboard into ball
she quite forgot  began to call
the thresholds thronged wetnurses call
whatever you may need just call
swiftly decayed beyond recall
i have no leisure to recall
like foliage in the rotting fall
like chatsky he arrived to fall
for angry heirs as one to fall
enquired the lady of the hall
brigade of liveries in the hall
packed from the maids wing to the hall
they all have swarmed into the hall
the keys that opened up the hall
are old times and the servants hall
no no Im sure the partys small
moonscape the halflight overall
of aunts and mothers and the thrall
guests bow feet scrape and children squall
lord byrons portrait on the wall
at any hour escape his cell
with scorn to make my world a hell
whether from heaven or from hell
shall make my story grim as hell
she went inside the empty shell
although its nearly heard the knell
my friends i need to pause a spell
and teaching children how to spell
since then martin Zadkas spell
beauty with all its heavenly spell
and walk and breathe before i tell
this angel this proud devil tell
from the agent with this tale to tell
he trembles knows not what to tell
is needed nothings left to tell
to tales that young moustachios tell
no quite naively Ill retell
still for ever fare thee well
the cunning prisoner can quite well
in his small shack will listen well
and breeding ducks and geese as well
spectacled age divines as well
hes happy yes hes almost well
in which our hero used to dwell
farewell familiar woods farewell
wished him to come and say farewell
spirit that anguish had made ill
that spring with me has had its fill
can read enough to get my fill
he reached the stream below the hill
she finds in river and in hill
onegin drenched with sudden chill
at twoball billiards prove his skill
early tomorrow at the mill
without an elegiac frill
sits there beside the windowsill
she sits down by the windowsill
and sat down by the windowsill
of work made him feel sick and still
lenskys estate there lives and still
darts to the boy and looks and still
as sacred lies before me still
he scowls  and the whole gang are still
but now vladimirs doubts are still
and heart so tender it can still
a country house  and one who still
empire and fled it happier still
she was the one who looked as still
princess alina She was still
drank in your words when all was still
the darkness thins away but still
a new acquaintance claims our quill
no word came flowing from his quill
such stubborn brain and vivid will
from early morning on he will
often she halts against her will
engaged then  but against her will
is he whos never felt its will
he drinks  all shout and take a swill
in play with her obedient doll
of raging passions surge and roll
then he presents her with the scroll
and watched a different world unroll
the worlds clat its thunderroll
that wit embarrasses the dull
to the complacent and the null
the child prepares for protocol
public opinion  heres our idol
graduates of the Levshin school
what feelings would assume control
has gone to Olga swept the girl
past all the assembly in a whirl
throughout their life so calm so peaceful
for them in Butterweek the greaseful
it is a friend I sing a youthful
the years would pass no longer youthful
i drop my hero Ill be truthful
perhaps however to be truthful
wild as a forest deer and fearful
but ever stranger and more fearful
a redfoot goose weight something fearful
shy as a savage silent tearful
and skids and tumbles down the cheerful
on gooses neck a skull looks cheerful
he stood there pensive and forgetful
happy is he whos known its fretful
evgeny stood with soul regretful
with sighs unconsciously regretful
is known today only a soul
oppressed by emptiness of soul
before such playfulness of soul
tatyana turned with thirsting soul
still captivated his young soul
not bad at all and then each soul
left quite alone with his own soul
with olga all have pierced her soul
hes called you out  say in your soul
had won her loyalty What soul
and swarming in his inmost soul
in vain on my unworthy soul
ever so roughly rocked my soul
or else lifts up a fallen shawl
or seminarist in yellow shawl
into an unbecoming brawl
at sunken wax inside a bowl
hes first to toast her in the bowl

impatiently on the milldam
in her torn heart  a fickle gleam
some other older spring will gleam
the kiss where youth and freshness gleam
has taken on a silvery gleam
to spoil loose paper by the ream
meanwhile a hallboy handed cream
oh god what did he think a dream
in midst of a poetic dream
freedoms enthusiastic dream
archcommentator of the dream
i liked his quality the dream
and as in some appalling dream
another a more chilling dream
adore the love that comes in dream
o brenta Ill see you in dream
of a delicious guiltless dream
or for that Demon of my dream
oppressed her like a heavy dream
all plunged his soul deep in the stream
down there by slow degrees the stream
its barely noticeable stream
the shady wood the talking stream
into the cups its darkling stream
the magic voices of your stream
retired as he from fashions stream

condemned the millstones as a sham
some ladies preach from Say and Bentham
the fear and rage with which I foam
walking the country that you roam
hereditary foes they seem
zizi my crystal and my gem
or he knew how to reconcile them
then later slyly hed revile them
the tighter we can stretch above them
with womankind the less we love them
a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them
stretched on a sofa calls to greet them
its true ill not misrepresent them
how they remind me of your stem
a lancer  how she deified him
schiller and Goethe had refined him
and our young poet  Olga fired him
and thoughts of her were what inspired him
he roamed the world his lyre behind him
lifes real meaning would have found him
at length midst children swarming round him
already there she stands beside him
he really forced one to admire him
my uncle  high ideals inspire him
at home shell equably receive him
but she refuses to perceive him
dared clean his nails in front of him
hes a freemason too for him
he wakes  and who is this who writes him
prince n respectfully invites him
cherries then well throw at him
and redcurrants throw at him
red wine in tumblers to the brim
of evening and those tears the balm
those walks amid the gloom and calm
they while away the mornings calm
could not conceive how solemn Grimm
tatyana its addressed to whom
despite herself is Lenskys doom
a humble cross in woodland gloom
the girl remains there in the gloom
and festal evenings in the gloom
a nightingale in forest gloom
fardistant heavens vaulted room
grows surges boils for lack of room
clears in a flash the freezing room
across the plains enormous room
millyonaya a street  parallel to the Neva and one block away from
to garden walks as arm in arm
enticing nets to do them harm
that lady whose engaging charm
the easier they become to charm
so effortlessly can disarm
there just in front of all that swarm
you see the two in uniform
to look like sad romanticism
dressed up a desperate egoism
semyn Petrvich mean and glum
at soldierhusbands and the drum
untirable at sound of drum
epochs portrayed survived the ban
and feel once more emotions ban
so if we want to change we can
of tempests in what raging ocean
asked Lensky Should we start I mean
the clamorous honking geese began
youve guessed before it all began
evgeny quietly began
as bonneted Academician
refers  to the  Circassian girl  in  Pushkins  poem  The  caucasian
how often on the steep caucasian
herder and even at times a russian
they should be forced to read in russian
between their girls and this halfrussian
and even honourable man
my strange incorrigible man
claiming Tatyanad found her man
works where contemporary man
for her improvement a roman
so a disabled soldierman
than households where the wife must moan
to lift his pistol up A span
and jokes and spiteful gossip ran
lay on the fields in caravan
the princess sitting peaked and wan
locked himself up inside his den
without surprise or rage his laden
and werther martyred and doomladen
her look so sweetly sorrowladen
books riding walks sleep heavyladen
heres tea the girls have just as bidden
when from behind the doorway hidden
sometimes from a fair blackeyed maiden
the flowerlike pallor of the maiden
she sees it all The simple maiden
all for our tender dreamy maiden
walked homeward round the kitchen garden
of happy love For I have been
and truffles which have ever been
of prejudice thats never been
however strongly she has been
on a small tables oilcloth sheen
return an answer blunt or keen
at once they give a man the spleen
of his own room how cruel spleen
use cunning silence as a screen
a marksman crouching in the green
so virtuous that no sooner seen
the hare who from afar has seen
the jug of bilberry wine is seen
and once forbidden fruit is seen
and on the flames let fall unseen
harboured by maidens of thirteen
a note from Lensky in between
in passions sluicing rain they freshen
i might have said a word and then
with deeds that dunces now and then
in lives that were just dawning then
to talk of this and that but then
gods thunder burn you up And when
were chanted I remember when
immortals picked by fate for when
oh nurse im sad Im sad Im shaken
but now the mansion is forsaken
a sledded coach for years forsaken
you find the country godforsaken
of chalk the windowpanes have taken
so to strange kinsfolk I was taken
our joy in you is warmly taken
departure dates long overtaken
you wrote to me and nothing spoken
moments of silence quite unbroken
the boring wives the illbred men
of blind Fortuna and of men
take wing on spite that serious men
of human friendship holy men
e sempre bene gentlemen
and with a yawn took up his pen
by baratynskys wondrous pen
martin zadka was the siren
tread the calm settled path theyve chosen
here comes the yardboy who has chosen
no look no word for him shes chosen
because some glance of his has bitten
in one so slothful so hardbitten
in love with fame by freedom smitten
the illness with which hed been smitten
what if your pistolshot has smitten
what odes Vladimir might have written
a swift polite reply is written
and foes he sees longsince forgotten
comrades despised and comrades rotten
notes to chapter seven
the untiring city where youve given
flown like an arrow then hes given
forsake indulgent reader  driven
up to the porch our heros driven
about them  nineteen to the dozen
to eugene nineteen to the dozen
she appears before him grim and frozen
the rogue has got a finger frozen
the sky is clear the earth is frozen
are here untouched by fashions reign
there caustic Shakhovsky came in
italian nights when Ill drink in
fat Pstyakov has driven in
drives home  and plunging deeper in
fortress captured from the Turks in
river  in  the  Crimea  The  reference  is to  the  harem  girls in
on liquor and on hay brought in
and entice a fellow in
when we draw a fellow in
was one who raged and raged again
would not have recognized again
of virgin fancy and again
the youthful lover once again
fate could be something else again
on this well part goodbye again
after two minutes off again
we sometimes like to hear again
from waxen cell the bees again
thought day and night and thought again
and looks out on the darkened plain
the charm of what was grave and plain
no all in her was calm and plain
already silvering all the plain
levy their tribute on the plain
she walked across a snowy plain
a furious boiling heaving main
in silence all day shed remain
radiance of Dian sits in pain
and rightly so but now his pain
her full account of voiceless pain
reduced to sense not without pain
advantages of heart and brain
to hit the target thigh or brain
god grant you took at least a grain
on modish malice coarse of grain
to whom do you from all the train
plunged in reflections deepest train
here seize it quick for this quatrain
to raise the safety catch and strain
of jealous girls devote its strain
a dwarf with tail and a halfstrain
something like spleen that scourge of Britain
to your loved ones They do maintain
but eugene hasnt moved for certain
of hills has hid the moon for certain
in that new couch no sleep for certain
he who has lived and thought is certain
days that are lost behind the curtain
round the dim river sleep the curtain
no sleep beneath that silken curtain
and parts the fringes of his curtain
oh this could all be false and vain
runs after what is sweet and vain
no artifices of the vain
it hurts he laughs and all in vain
he deemed in general letters vain
for mistresslike its brilliant vain
that this of all things for a swain
once more renounces world and din
with comedies of swarm and din
he heard in stillness and in din
in midst of trouble storm or din
but salt near the princess a vein
tatyanas letter to Onegin
yet hed back you through thick and thin
whose serfs are miserably thin
a deathless murmur from within
through it theyre known to me and kin
on kennels and on kith and kin
he loves you like your kith and kin
surer than friendship or than kin
hussar and friend of pushkin

and pay my debt in the same coin
but i wont praise you  let me join
the spring of honour and the pin
on which the world is doomed to spin
he was a good and simple barin
a humble sinner Dimitry larin
melmoth the Wanderer by C R Mathurin
buynov my vivacious cousin
so often from her Moscow cousin
hero of mathilde by Sophie Cottin
and the derivative Knyazhnn
leads Olga and Tatyana on
since through the mist that dreams arise on
swaying the artless waiting on
he saw no point in staying on
the roundest face that youve set eyes on
alone with no adornment on
invariably as time went on
in duels a pedantic don
on a fast stallion from the don
by country freedom rightful pardon
a statuette of Napoleon
he looks and answers Agafon
yet peoples malice and suspicion
now dont suppose let no suspicion
im yours in a predestined fashion
hes seen it all with looks and fashion
they fluff her curls out in the fashion
ended his wild career of fashion
no softball for the winds of fashion
but now ive praised the queens of fashion
amid the deadening joys of fashion
all this has now gone out of fashion
in musics own bewitching fashion
ill conjure up that swooning fashion
wronged always in disgraceful fashion
had gone in no uncertain fashion
hope that hes had no time to fashion
if i had power to choose your fashion
evgeny thought in just this fashion
sharing her in promiscuous fashion
tatyana pined in secret fashion
already in exultant fashion
of hope and gloom romanticfashion
in which the rhymestermanoffashion
when i defected from their union
how often with her sweet communion
fonvizin sparkled freedoms champion
enchanted land There like a lampion
you acted well that dread occasion
he reads to Olga on occasion
her secret work of magic suasion
of moralistical persuasion
earnestly striving for persuasion
your icy look your stern dissuasion
how dull are acting and evasion
then tanya hears of the decision
stands in dismay and indecision
to puzzle out with some precision
thirtytwo steps with great precision
which has recalled without precision
to face societys derision
stays fixed and focused on a vision
tatyanas haunted by her vision
which listening with some condescension
perhaps some secret apprehension
they all have richly earned a pension
over the note holds in suspension
in the white heat of some dissension
he got so used to this immersion
as with old friends she craves diversion
or joined us poets His conversion
in gossips rambling and discursion
let not the poets soul of passion
the arbitrary rules of passion
excited not a hint of passion
than this humiliating passion
he sends a letter penned with passion
he gave this figure  loved with passion
facing a belle i loved with passion
but you grand tomes I loathe with passion
gives way to natures normal passion
but when the hour of youthful passion
but even by accident her passion
in terms of poetry or passion
the foreign words a maidens passion
pouted and swore in furious passion
the sufferings of tempestuous passion
this was the science of that passion
hes viewed the boxes without passion
to battle further with my passion
at eighteen years to some compassion
my friends the bard stirs your compassion
three carts  traditional procession
when in pale sky the stars procession
she wrote in French what a confession
i write to you  no more confession
in casual letters of confession
well i must make a frank confession
as lovingly in his confession
that virgin dream and its confession
will anger you in its confession
i make magnanimous confession
to sob out prayer complaint confession
he failed to join that sharp profession
our kin are folk whom by profession
at feasts though full of pert aggression
bard of The Feasts and hearts depression
the fateful diet by depression
a grain of gladness tears repression
there many pages keep the impression
yet tanyas note made its impression
but if youve kept some faint impression
pleasant in spite of its compression
so let me with a kind expression
vladimirs challenge found expression
in russian never found expression
what scorn I see in the expression
before such candour of expression
the poets heart found full expression
how i interpret this expression
ripen and find a new expression
and tried to write but a hard session
she loved the balcony the session
her feelings in their weary session
on these with something like obsession
shadelike in purposeless obsession
rage died and jealousys obsession
how fearful too is my obsession
with every sort of home possession
one listened to a chief of mission
his lyre now stilled in its high mission
a thinker in a desert mission
pours out its guiltless frank admission
before she goes she seeks permission
evgeny whom the repercussion
nothing was barred beyond discussion
a lady  what a grim discussion
as soon as he appears discussion
zaretsky rose without discussion
your molten gold your charmed infusion
her discomposure her confusion
and plunged in tender shames confusion
an idle monk in glum seclusion
the manor house in deep seclusion
ill float in gondolas seclusion
dear tanya lover of illusion
what else Quite drunk with loves illusion
he followed them without illusion
expose his soul to an intrusion
screened by a hill from storms intrusion
lost them without regrets contusion
her loving spouse with approbation
hells terrifying imprecation
at verse and hiss an imprecation
idle again by dedication
o adrian waves my invocation
and all our modish education
it mastered him in slow gradation
tatyana sees with trepidation
etcetera But her trepidation
seeing herself as a creation
the millions of twolegged creation
of eugene cold as all creation
have you read lines of your creation
the fleeting works of my creation
shell not see him her obligation
evgeny hating litigation
he strove to achieve the appropriation
in indescribable elation
the prince bring up his own relation
of philosophic isolation
our terror is their consolation
rebuffed found instant consolation
that corps of social legislation
a hideous deal of tribulation
so full of heartfelt tribulation
this wearisome perambulation
in time to quote the calculation
alone and sunk in calculation
compliment and congratulation
but here with our congratulation
in tanya what a transformation
to give you honest explanation
compassion yes and indignation
to batten down their indignation
somehow have got the designation
secure a secret assignation
prides icy calm the combination
and all our fresh imagination
ill gladden your imagination
before his eyes imagination
come trouble my imagination
thank god he had no inclination
yet a capricious inclination
too long against my inclination
sign of the urge for domination
and home was now their destination
the coach has reached its destination
im altering my destination
she struck one as the incarnation
i know and seek your exculpation
even at home his occupation
but the salons preoccupation
then hed implore a declaration
tatyanas name day celebration
would have been spared this laceration
bards of our tearful generation
where are distress commiseration
by writers of her admiration
when our sublimest aspiration
napoleons our sole inspiration
where dwelt this child of inspiration
fired by the god of inspiration
whose glance provoking inspiration
hear once more filled with inspiration
fieldwork and walks with inspiration
but come thou youthful inspiration
a moment earlier inspiration
bittersweet glorys inspiration
with careful schemes of decoration
of his ochkov decoration
with fond caress whose adoration
though belles had lost his adoration
when progress and amelioration
she enjoys the stately orchestration
with a blunt cue for the duration
and in the misted condensation
with our mamas and a sensation
it had no sparkle of sensation
then gradually upon sensation
and logic yet the conversation
to talk to general conversation
this was our heroes conversation
i like a friendly conversation
no mannerism no affectation
lefthanded from the habitation
the strangeness of her habitation
lost in our backwoods habitation
in time who knows the agitation
trusted her without hesitation
i saturday The invitation
another bard in exaltation
you see with tears and incantation
so to his wife for presentation
where fate had fixed our confrontation
of course yet fashions wild rotation
thrives to this moment in a station
mother implored me my sad station
how soon the bounds of rank and station
before the window taking station
with mounts from home or postal station
my gaze pursues them but on station
is where old master took up station
and from the nearby Army station
had filled this heart and detestation
must be to hold in detestation
the invalids glad salutation
when eugenes turn for salutation
on words of foreign derivation
finding in that no deprivation
i pray God grant his soul salvation
what kind of thought what observation
i thank him without reservation
tatyana listened with vexation
the kinsfolk in concerted action
of russian verse its force in action
with shelves of books deployed for action
of his intent and a reaction
of childish pranks a chilled reaction
for natures unadorned reaction
the nervoustragical reaction
the quintessential reaction
by whats called machinal reaction
the brilliant crackpot this reaction
he read and read  no satisfaction
a pause of silence and inaction
she cant make out a single fraction
he gave his arm In sad abstraction
present her languor and distraction
lensky all evening in distraction
had long proved tedious to distraction
what dream accounts for her distraction
rousseau forgive a short distraction
tatyana never knew the attraction
its true the magnetlike attraction
but you perhaps find no attraction
in time past objects of affection
i grasp a stirrup with affection
i gave no rein to sweet affection
i feel a brotherly affection
with such a blissful brief infection
whatever in this rough confection
showed one a pattern of perfection
the universe is all perfection
arrested by the sheer perfection
and always the selfsame objection
on eugenes lips In his dejection
for him all sham has found rejection
ive drawn a plan and a projection
and charming reveries vain deflection
the man of reverie and reflection
what holds her in profound reflection
is lost in obstinate reflection
almanacs journals of reflection
a dreams mute monument reflection
lending his tone a grave inflection
he lacked the slightest predilection
what held me was my predilection
to reading from this odd collection
he found them in some old collection
absorbed me in the recollection
another page of recollection
then on the leaves of recollection
you sought  tumultuous recollection
hes gnawed by serpent recollection
but groomed an anecdotecollection
poets Ill say in this connection
the books then underwent inspection
walking her horse in introspection
but looks and talk took the direction
dogs howling rushed in her direction
i trust my fate to your direction
all brought to life at your direction
reader whatever fates direction
she wanders on without direction
but where such hymns in my direction
how dull to work for the correction
all right you want the resurrection
to undertake their resurrection
ive dreams and years past resurrection
meanwhile my novels opening section
tanyas distress had risked detection
giving the lady their protection
i weep and pray for your protection
theres far too much of contradiction
drink in the midnight benediction
in dreams and cards and their prediction
my span that fortunes jurisdiction
from gaol to greenwood by such fiction
meticulously in my fiction
i must wake up with the conviction
tatyana shared with full conviction
it stood defiant of destruction
the chteau was of a construction
i know its now in your discretion
how soft his glance or at discretion
i would have had the indiscretion
untouched by trace of inhibition
into his look the exhibition
ive learnt the voice of new ambition
a joker in the old tradition
the larins kept the old tradition
he changed the corve of tradition
the guardian angel of tradition
the unmetric verses of tradition
only by rule and strict tradition
a modish secondhand edition
the modesty of her condition
tatyana hiding her condition
perhaps to improve the worlds condition
those words where love without condition
she yields to it without condition
at this midnight of my condition
or some vile agent of perdition
fate saved Evgeny from perdition
with spelling scrambled to perdition
the flirt has reasons cool volition
and yet a distant admonition
of the two girls their premonition
his unexpected apparition
protect me from such apparition
what is he Just an apparition
was it not you dear apparition
im blind to every apparition
a truly noble disposition
methodical by disposition
oh nurse a favour a petition
the first will never find fruition
at first madame gave him tuition
vladimir to this casual mention
and so he lacks the strength to mention
and then its tea that comes to mention
its late times passing not to mention
but ive not got the least intention
shes paid the sunrise no attention
what cause has won me your attention
her husbands or the worlds attention
now brooding thoughts hold his attention
hes bowed politely his attention
now she devours with what attention
devoured a book with rapt attention
and whisper Dunya pay attention
hell charm you with his fine invention
and all their ravishing invention
zaretsky draws up a convention
could it not be that by convention
in our affair the intervention
deaf to her sisters intervention
she went  and Eugene all emotion
our hapless Tanya An emotion
tatyana in a deep emotion
your tears would flow  but your emotion
what sort of roses in your notion
she drinks it like a priceless potion
of wild repentance and devotion
eugene forsakes the packed reception
by dreams now sad in their conception
more tolerant in his conception
yet as each rule has its exception
then on the last page the suggestion
though hes unknown theres no suggestion
times were when masters least suggestion
on the first sheet youll find a question
that hes not honest past all question
oh nyanya nyanya I dont question
what folly and what retribution
he almost begs for absolution
he looks in sweet irresolution
freedom and peace in substitution
bribetaker glutton and buffoon
that rogue backbiter pantaloon
but now the radiance of the moon
thoughts of a girl or as the moon
she was alone lit by the moon
a rogue a slanderer a poltroon
good night I swear Ill lie down soon
is dimmed Down there the valley soon
young traitresses by the platoon
byron
by scott by Seneca or Byron
escaped from social rhyme and reason
to burn  and then by force of reason
each day despite the appeals of reason
to demonstrate some signs of reason
imagination with such reason
but what about Eugene With reason
like modish rhymes that lack all reason
so seeing there no rhyme or reason
hes neither died nor lost his reason
if id possessed the slightest reason
is a compulsive bore by reason
of your slim prints though this be treason
the days flew past by now the season
how fearful in and out of season
he drives up in and out of season
no meaning in or out of season
at first i thought it out of season
by contrast in the frozen season
craving your tolerance in season
burst to a fiery blaze in season
in backwoods how dyou pass this season
i was onegins friend that season
what grandison oh Grandison
a dumb moon on a dumb horizon
a free romances far horizon
my disillusioned glass and yearn
became their scrutinys concern
something to fritter and to burn
of fate and life each in its turn
that alien scene must I now turn
and it deceived us in return
for friends of languor or of fun
last night hed erred in making fun
a ball in Petersburg but fun
one sees a duck and aims his gun
and soon his travels had begun
the festal name day has begun
as battles go Ive not begun
dont judge the race before its run
her heart had long been overrun
from daybreak valleys lift the sun
and paler than the moon at dawn
and trembles like a hunted fawn
for olga on the spreading lawn
were from his vision quite withdrawn
her little friends Tatyanad yawn
onset of the incipient yawn
and read the books there on her own
fits us as if it were our own
has driven off to find his own
to be the bride Id call my own
imagine it quite on my own
due punishment was handed down
till he at last was summoned down
the branches all are weighted down
whose kindly hand will ruffle down
of muses offspring sitting down
not every day could he wash down
the darling sex is light as down
her head in modesty cast down
sleep much read little and put down
the thought of volatile renown
and lovelorn maiden whom hed known
if not slowwitted might have known
moves the young watcher as was known
to bee and butterfly unknown
and once again received a crown
and at the altar with a crown
her to the altar and the crown
the laurel in the old mans crown
to vice while virtue got its crown
his beefsteak with champagne or drown
would talk keep silent laugh then frown
in the full beauty of its frown
cant really be for weve outgrown
yet floods of talk around the town
the latest fashions of the town
shed cheer my wordless way and do
she did what nurse advised she do
just half a glass more that will do
enough i tell you that will do
the shepherd as he used to do
blooms when theres nothing else to do
than what our sorrowing rhymesters do
onegin without more ado
still meek still deaf as howdyoudo
where did that glum eccentric go
that selfsame evening where hed go
as fast as posthorses could go
she flies as fast as she can go
i think Im happy Time to go
is that my feet lack strength to go
bedtime and time for guests to go
see with their jugs the milkgirls go
i married I beseech you go
glitter and tumble as they go
have drenched the steel bit as they go
a soul that perished long ago
as instituted long ago
and roused the village long ago
of language which so long ago
in lyce gardens long ago
since i stopped sinning years ago
a frequent question tell me who
with a venetian maiden who
was brought there by a huckster who
it will be our descendants who
thought them a pointless peccadillo
sacred to children of Apollo
you know him do you Yes and no
or pine persuade of yes or no
and on the crumpled sofa too
and hows Tatyana Olga too
the heros names decided too
of grammar Russian language too
onegin sits at table too
and ran far off the Muse came too
in such an album friends i too
her handkerchief has fallen too
so pious and so clever too
out of this world will crowd us too
can chatter and be silent too
let evening pass tomorrow too
but spared no glance for Cicero
who on earth is he not our hero
like irksome phantoms null as zero
after that suppers served and so
they were her only food and so
his consciences record and so
made all fates look the same and so
with your good offices and so
enough my friends its all soso
this time I think youve been reduced to
you yawn Onegin As Im used to
tatyanas heart is rent in two
notes to chapter two
still eats and drinks enough for two
that night in secret set for two
but dinners served so two by two
a quilted chamberrobe and cap
punctilious in his cotton cap
in flannel and an old fur cap
himself just like a simple chap
and introduced for the last lap
the floor serves Triquet for his nap
sometimes hed fall into a trap
has opened up his servingtrap
and all the world is buried deep
land where my heart is buried deep
mountains will part below the deep
the maidens all are slumbering deep
the heartache that they bring lies deep
so let it be for you to keep
two hearts there are perhaps that keep
though cold I am and sad in sleep
only tatyana does not sleep
across each bush across each steep
land where i learned to love and weep
henceforth in front of you i weep
a tear for him but whats to weep
over the waters in a sweep
she never even bit her lip
upon her feverish tongue the slip
and any moment down hell slip
the letter trembles in her grip
taken the saucers in their grip
paled flushed or lost composures grip
will find the ice elude his grip
bassoons and flutes begin to trip
by judgement of the modern camp
song laughter whistle bark and champ
almost as good as a dim lamp
and human words and horses stamp
heres petushkv the local fop
a plain unceremonious troop
from thirty down to two and stop
my student cell she opened up
and good and bad are all mixed up
he arrives  the cork goes flying up
delicious novels laps them up
with parks and mansions open up
get up my child its time get up
in his defence and smash it up
of spires and belfries in a cup
the wineaddict adores the cup
wine of the Comet fills the cup
recall by its bewitching cup
the joys of youth that festal cup
with sheer enchantment fills her cup
their hand to grapple slanders cup
with a small tray and a teacup
neighbours and friends in kindly group
my last poor lepton for a sup
buynov tried  got flea in ear
tatyana seeks to attune her ear
at the same moment in her ear
how tanyas grown I pulled your ear
is kit to every maidens ear
with fright she hears the approaching bear
our friend Katnin brought to bear
oh  propos Larins a dear
so lensky answered the old dear
sweet as a lovers kiss and dear
unseen already you were dear
ditty portends a loss more dear
my golden days when spring was dear
those friends those friends it is I fear
the olden days I want to hear
sunk in dejection she wont hear
look quickly to the left dyou hear
never come and overhear
by waters that were still and clear
my soul had heard your voice ring clear
as gay as morning and as clear
an urge to sleep soon clear as clear
villages flickered far and near
for the first time the Muse came near
open the window sit down near
the talk of guests when they appear
to see the grave and shed a tear
how brilliant with its instant tear
as linens brought for him to wear
the hunter in the wood will swear
this dear still world I must forswear
had been for ever borne off far
no tanyas more endearing far
would fill Tatyana from afar
when we see him from afar
the lover of Julie Wolmar
and malek Adel de Linar
and soon they bring her a guitar
in the dark sky a shooting star
and parted from her by their star
but your vile Helens not my star
complete with broadbrimmed bolivar
and dunya works the samovar
here near Saint Simeon in December
grandison cousin dyou remember
comes for awakening comes for slumber
whether the arrow has my number
back to his regiment the lancer
but here comes our loudtalking prancer
dont let a ghost be your bearleader
myself and Eugene lest a reader
your loved one honourable reader
of mocking turn or else a breeder
in my long task be my upholder
enough the load is off my shoulder
and yet in vain ennui I squander
in winter on the castiron fender
such careless language of surrender
who taught her an address so tender
my love for it is just as tender
could i just see the house i wonder
can it be she Eugene in wonder
i drag my footsteps hither yonder
that huge ballrooms vibrated under
from deepest backwood furthest under
shes mine Evgenys voice of thunder
now the mazurka sounds Its thunder
rushed to Anisias room to plunder
the whole thieves kitchen flies asunder
her heart speaks to her even louder
her passion burns with stronger powder
and from within come noise and cheer
and exclamations and good cheer
word on his lips and thought its sheer
ladies at the fireside confer
sought in her book that text of danger
who walks with sorrow and with danger
a backward look is fraught with danger
roamed the still forest like a ranger
but from her shaggyliveried ranger
by fates decree this freakish stranger
some future dunce will point a finger
then know that your reproving finger
i weep in case there still should linger
perhaps  for flattering hope will linger
dawn comes in mist and chill no longer
tatyana now need wait no longer
in pairs their hunger driving stronger
this is the one Ah ever stronger
whats more I loved you but my hunger
for then Onegin I was younger
for it was custom that consoled her
soon a great truth came to enfold her
but where mid tragic storms that rend her
bound where the magic bow will send her
once vyzemsky who chanced to find her
her souls attention just behind her
the citys early sounds awake her
her heartache did it long compel her
olga she thinks what fate befell her
to my astonishment Ive seen her
to a soire My God to her
around her neck or when for her
into a corner gently makes her
alone with him Onegin takes her
shes in the wood the bear still trails her
now a protruding branch assails her
by magic everything instils her
all day all night his presence fills her
ladies came over crossed to meet her
the doorway opened wide to meet her
at once anisia came to greet her
and bending deeply down to greet her
has left and no one here has met her
she hesitates and doubts beset her
tatyanas here you know Ive brought her
grey Filatevna to present her
dancer and choreographer
love passed the Muse appeared the weather
i walk the shore I watch the weather
hoarfrost and sun in freezing weather
and after jealousys grim weather
his life went sailing in calm weather
still shivering in the bitter weather
no ice and flame no stormy weather
to kissing or caressing father
after a fine career his father
he gave three balls a year and rather
she never joined or skipped but rather
so verse and prose they came together
some neighbours there have come together
now free I once more weave together
a joking flirt or both together
ill part them bring them back together
their lords and thwack their palms together
sledges and tardy dawns together
sometimes the evening brought together
bliss was so near so altogether
a wondrous tenderness and whether
they talk of her of how and whether
is firmly cast I dont know whether
when comes my moment to untether
and not because shed read him either
lovelace or Grandison or neither
hussars on leave are racing hither
here insolent prizedandies wither
what nonsense Tanya in those other
foes is it long since from each other
rendered them tedious to each other
why at the thought my husbands mother
and in the role of virtuous mother
i would have found a friend another
you pile one eclogue on another
long since like brother linked to brother
became like brother knit to brother
for gods sake that will do But brother
servant of God and Brigadier

no moralizing from this joker
without preliminary feeler
pistols are out they gleam the hammer
faceted muzzles by the rammer
while dear Tatyanas youth grows dimmer
and health lifes sweetness and its shimmer

he cursed Theocritus and homer
gvozdn exemplary farmer
here with his wife that bulging charmer
lover of Valrie by Madame de Krudener
but just to make the bargain keener
when weve retreated to the banner
while under the connubial banner
exercised under lucres banner
of passions out and its whole manner
a novel in Lafontaines manner
please follow me And heres the inner
and tea and supper theres an inner
here in the winter hed have dinner
he fed on hopes deceptive dinner
ill feed the journalists for dinner
i like to tell the time by dinner
in hearts affairs a sweet beginner
you newborn work and like a winner
into the mud a drunken goner
unswerving friend correct landowner
meanwhile another new landowner
give me a pen and give me paper
she never read a Russian paper
bring up a table and a taper
of secrets like a friend but dearer
oh her young dove the natural hearer

eugene was free and as a dresser
on cups of coffee and then later

francesco Albani Italian painter
panes patterned by the finest printer
and hills that delicately winter
why not Id choose the other quarter
could they not give each other quarter
and so your faithfullest supporter
two poles that ice had glued like plaster
pale transcript of a vivid master
spelt hazard ruin and disaster
fraught with enticement and disaster
longtime inside this modish cloister
its late a breeze begins to roister
just look and never mind the chatter
there was a general furtive chatter
he fled from their resounding chatter
that we enjoy equating chatter
no incorrect and careless chatter
true with a pistol he could shatter
the world of fashion prone to flatter
look to the left where whats the matter
conjecture found unending matter
find in the trivial serious matter
their talk so sound on every matter
evoke emotions pitterpatter
of seeing the world what on earth could be better
a blank default would suit me better
with his forefathers would seem better
make juvenal his text or better
no answer comes he goes for better
who could have looked the poet better
add vale when he signed a letter
but go he wont for him a letter
no answer comes another letter
then send your grandson with this letter
but thats enough my beautys letter
still as a shadow grim and bitter
but brighter than the heavenly litter
the night has many stars that glitter
she found evgeny eyes aglitter
tatyanas letter treasured ever
shes not in love Theres no one ever
that raves with poetry can ever
your chorus is it dead for ever
fare thee well and if for ever
maybe bore off with it for ever
decreed in highest court for ever
for me to glimpse this Phyllis ever
time was hed been the wittiest ever
he asks She cant accept Why ever
so gloriously hed fool the clever
to larina Tatyana never
to evgeny Oh God shed never
and yet that goddess whom id never

and he was loved at least he never
present me please Youre joking never

russias terpsichore shall never
and ivan Petushkv no never
another no another never
ah he had loved a love that never
importune with my lyre whenever
happy a hundredfold whoever
youre married No idea whatever
onegin turns and with a shiver
and put our heart into a shiver
and so in winterfields will shiver
that fell and then began to shiver
even in joke the heart wont shiver
led to the princess all ashiver
glitters beneath its icingsliver
like modish parquetry the river
from drownings death in Lethe river
toward the neighbouring valleys river
and someones heart will feel a quiver
not once a day a thought will quiver
so the poor butterfly will quiver
her face would pale shed start to quiver
dip in their jugs where shadows quiver
killed At this frightful word aquiver
perhaps when thoughts are all aquiver
hes up the steps with heart aquiver
with an obeisance Ill hand over
there sings the nightingale springs lover
on finlands coast a lonely rover
with brilliant conquests by the shower
squeezes her hand  and brings to flower
you too prime beauties in your flower
his freedom in his youths first flower
no fuss our belly has the power
not separations chilling power
by drozhkies jaunting at full power
so nearly had them in his power
lensky at home awaits the answer
presently Olgas ringing answer
to encase herself inside a layer
to whisper it her inmost prayer
hes at the club a real stayer
shes up and flying through the air
dont waste your efforts on the air
the moon in its azure of air
her heart had spoken free as air
of twelfth Nights chillest iciest air
moscows the place the marriagefair
the girls pale charms her loosened hair
a deft arrangement to his hair
they shove each plate and every chair
and shout and make room for the pair
exists for me one special pair
or did her grief soon find repair
deaf to the voice of your despair
in past concierge up marble stair
its yes or no but never sir
ill go Ill go  and in a stir
no nothing caused his heart to stir
wholl never fault our vices or
see first Snow  a poem by Prince Vyazemsky Pushkins note for
our love is what they most abhor
but when hed rushed to Uncles manor
the cabinet behind the door
he carries her inside the door
november stood outside the door
all stand He walks towards the door
she knows you Why we lived next door
the logs the wild ones have the floor
from table clattering on the floor
and sets her gently on the floor
however scarlet free from error
to me unsmiling lips bring terror
made londons dandy his professor
lightly attired like the creator
vladimir lensky whose creator
don Juans and the Giaours creator
hes off  this ruthless legislator
hed listen to the administrator
my sweet god warrants me your debtor
for the footlights this fickle traitor
simple old lady but the liquor
in corners whispering girls concur
touches her hand or throws a fur
and nothing pierced his senses blur
the vote was passed without demur
and looked for Lensky while the labour
lets go our friendships worth the labour
or after some dull dinners labour
i buttonhole a wandering neighbour
olinka yawned just like her neighbour
by way of toast to their fair neighbour
the linen stretched on the tambour
then with a halfethereal splendour
and brandishes her tinsel splendour
notes to chapter four
are treated to the fullest rigour
lets go the friends all haste and vigour
whispers some ballad of the hour
clock in the country rings the hour
one customary grief each hour
my inept pupil at that hour
exhausted by the ballrooms clamour
he sleeps away from glare and glamour
id nothing to attract your humour
then in the backwoods far from rumour
no soon she changed her old demeanour
having by her severe demeanour
like regulus that god of honour
her russian was as thin as vapour
to liven with a silk atour
now latins gone quite out of favour
of the dull shores of my disfavour
onegin knew enough to savour
to mourn for Russias gloomy savour
lasciate  ogni  speranza voi chentrate  Our modest  author  has
beneath birdcherries and acacias
with her own forests and her meads
but the swift summertime proceeds
with tears in quarters of the maids
hero of louvets novel about betrayed husbands
the valleys dark The forest lands
as if spellbound Tatyana stands
insists when the mazurka ends
and neighbours followed the same ends
and tedious means to festive ends
i know too surely how it ends
forgot to think of town and friends
dear companions darling friends
on most occasions between friends
for them by fathers who as friends
by enemies no less by friends
on this unstable life my friends
and by repentance All this lends
persisted and made no amends
on the cotillion as amends
she lost the language of the gods
for the bleak tongue of boorish clods
mills lands and waters  he whose goods
the total ownership of woods
no mansions no ballrooms no bards
a fop a punter on the cards
although there are no streets no cards
and junior Ensign in the Guards
and trains a mirror till it faces
in country towns and suchlike places
goes out into the courtyard spaces
and in their daughters close embraces
at first by Moscows youthful graces
as fresh as ever for its graces
lord byron with his shrewd caprices
to all the most adored actrices
with bended knees a windmill dances
from early on she loved romances
recalling earlier times romances
its sails go flapflap as it prances
to expose to Moscow fops and Circes
but in zaretsky he induces
and in the yard stand eighteen jades
fieldward in noisy swarm the bees
theres powdery snow up to her knees
till moscow meekly on its knees
and ananas the gold of trees
and clasps her neck and now she sees
but now our roads are bad the ages
the prejudices of the ages
vain twaddle fables of the ages
love tyrannises all the ages
with broods of children of all ages
sensitive ladies of all ages
as sadi sang in earlier ages
and featherbeds and birds in cages
the secrets of the grave the pages
of those who heard my opening pages
but in it there are certain pages
a blessing from its blasts and rages
theres din of parting now that rages
and the skotnins grizzled sages
priamlike agricultural sages
and bedbug that infest the stages
parks monasteries towers and ledges
peasants and fashionshops and sledges
a rest from toil and all its aches
the jams appear in little dishes
the protocol is all one wishes
she fell in love with all the fancies
of dians visage in our fancies
her outoffashion clothes oh mercies
upon her lips the breathing dies
and almost swoons and almost dies
of swooning Tanya nearly dies
just what the nightmare signifies
all are dumbfounded Lensky shies
damns the intruders Tanya lies
is there to lisp its pack of lies
through the back porch runs out and flies
look through the pane and squash the flies
the reader thinks the rhyme is lilies
the prince looks at him and replies
cheek upon hand she softly cries
in a still stream that never dries
cherries throw and raspberries
and other more exacting worries
my pen as once no longer hurries
plagued by her ghastly dream and tries
playwrights of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
by any itch for marriage ties
resigned himself to prisons ties
of goblets tall and slender pretties
you object of my guileless ditties
of course the love of tender beauties
that generations of new beauties
that verse will turn to useful duties
will loyally discharge its duties
or just grammatical mistakes
brushes on thirty different scales
lies in a coverlet that ripples
shes here she spreads abroad she stipples
his wit according to the rules
using overt or covert rules
the horns and the moustachiod nozzles
the eyes of all the hooves the snozzles
how many lines of verse and themes
and teas brought in Instead of chimes
for whom to expiate your crimes
eight rubbers and by now eight times
youve made so many secret rhymes
ah gently gently easy goes
but friendship as between our heroes
your heels will squash the ladies toes
to comfort her in all her woes
its views its passions or its cares
triquet ingenious poet dares
although one in no manner shares
the crush the heat as music blares
europes most finely chiselled wares
and jam in jars and household wares
across the driftencumbered acres
to me so simply with the fires
and force that purity inspires
the guests squeeze closer to the centres
calm men with beatific features
its time kindhearted idle creatures
melmoth whose roaming never ceases
twirls the other slowly as she pleases
with eyes aflame Onegin rises
but then a sudden breeze surprises
frightening with all despairs disguises
la morale est dans la nature des choses
as smoke in azure sky disperses
addressed to tanya certain verses
no one recalls him or his verses
inside a pocket Triquet nurses
the inevitable silly asses
here in his red peruke and glasses
behind the door the clash of glasses
straight to his stall then turns his glasses
high rank of course and fashions glasses
blush to descry in lookingglasses
applause Onegin enters  passes
his thrusting horns and as he passes
has come with Kharlikov he passes
tatyana looks her faintness passes
each others and their own successes
the beauties in their flimsy dresses
and so the harmless chat progresses
the swarm the glittering mob that presses
in olga everything expresses
the skyblue eyes the flaxen tresses
young ladies jump for future blisses
the footmen sleep on the pelisses
this denizen of the coulisses
round tanya congregate the misses
onegin comes and makes excuses
along the fronts of darkened houses
what invitations Yes three houses
some days hes still in bed and drowses
along the street where slumber drowses
for the two ladies at the gates
menu hung up for show excites
the thoughts of my two anchorites
all sorts of hopeless appetites
qucrirezvous sur ces tablettes
the children spoilt the mad the rogues
critics and their capricious vogues
french poet  Author of Posies Erotiques
an albums loose and floating sheaves
to lie down at her feet like slaves
how envious was I of the waves
is only Olga he relieves
for olgas beauty Lensky gives
that fills him and in which he lives
like a majestic moon she drives
while roar of violins contrives
among the maidens and the wives
to drown the hiss of modish wives
away from trusting his own eyes
down to the garden and her eyes
and scroll in hand before her eyes
noise in her ears glare in her eyes
stripping my soul before your eyes
of kindling smiles in ladies eyes
when our zaretsky met his eyes
like fluff before Aeolian breezes
how well he donned new shapes and sizes
in britzkas kibtkas and sleighs
hoarfrost that crackles with a will is
frontwise and back that way and this
you learn lifes sweetness and with this
then quickly something changed all this
ive learnt new sadness but in this
their breed would some years after this
i find no sense the truth is this
cafrestaurant in Paris
shall i see you As Tanya speaks
bokharans orchards merchants shacks
that ardent youth entirely lacks
it blabs and spills them in its tracks
boulevards chemists and Cossacks
the tears in stream pour down her cheeks
haphazard so to God be thanks
frost gleams We watch with gleeful thanks
to pass for cultured in our ranks
old mother winter at her pranks
entered his sentence in the books
nor will my scribbling in such books
unanimous exchange of looks
nonsense will earn indulgent looks
some disagreeable remarks
the modish Record Office clerks
brings out its faro pack and deals
to scorn the men with whom he deals
and thought a sleepy numbness steals
and so they lived two ageing mortals
into the tombs wide open portals
ghostlike must trouble him who feels
the country cottages and hovels
to her flowergarden to her novels
brushes for teeth brushes for nails
the tusks the corpses fingernails
the bleeding tongues the tufted tails
and that embittered mind which boils
in empty deeds and futile toils
come to me in my golden halls
boys country women stately halls
and hetman of the gamblinghalls
the boxes boiling pit and stalls
street lamps go flashing by and stalls
in boxes or the rows of stalls
or quizzingglasses of knowalls
the early pealing of the bells
lifts her from bed as it foretells
the snow from all surrounding hills
down to the plain in turbid rills
so brilliantly hed hoax the fools
but whispers the guffaw of fools
feeling is quaint and fit for fools
for us are instruments and tools
the song of the girls
the ring of marriageable girls
bludgeon the sense it faints and whirls
then help me God she caterwauls
zartsky sometime king of brawls
and up the rustling curtain crawls
and life celestials phantom gleams
russias old glories and their gleams
stuff of the poets hallowed dreams
the heart and all its fragile dreams
im wandering in a world of dreams
o never know these frightful dreams
for jokes and rows and merry dreams
to sleep some black and empty dreams
theres no ignoble tale that seems
ah tanya come to me it seems
while odes have high and noble aims
empty the purpose it proclaims
in dream toward the woods and plains
the funeral monument explains
above the dust of his remains
of bogdanvichs refrains
she finds it stifling here she strains
as youthful sinning or the strains
and of the cupboards one contains
and says Farewell you vales and fountains
farewell you too familiar mountains
no trace of ink no spots no stains
tomcat calls  Kit   a song  foretelling marriage  Pushkins
the muses lofty arts and fashions
for the sublime and for the passions
it led him in these early sessions
alone amid all his possessions
for  his obligations
the legatee of his relations
a book of household calculations
the safest place for declarations
in days of carefree aspirations
such were a young rakes meditations
a russian familys old traditions
legends and mystical traditions
no secret crimes and no perditions
rumours and threats and premonitions
poor tanya more intensely burns
sleep runs from her she turns and turns
old prejudice all men are zeros
an ode in twentyfive cantos
its pristine charm heeltaps and leaps
i thought shell go this time perhaps
and whiskers  all of this it keeps
like native idiom from their lips
and its the foreign phrase that trips
of ladies and of freakish fops
project in silhouette the tops
beds bridges lawn she never stops
in sledded coaches and coups
ill set two ages by the ears
that lives and glitters and endears
threats vows and simulated fears
the friends salute she never hears
but hold my tongue lest it appears
and soon oh soon the storms arrears
by sixpage letters rings and tears
im grieving still but no more tears
and than these letters and these tears
and from her eyes the eager tears
at least you then showed for my years
the odious bear still grunts and lumbers
ahead of them a pinewood slumbers
lorgnettes of jealous fashionleaders
to happen long ago dear readers
am i estranged does all that cheers
across the publics toes he steers
but now auroras crimson fingers
the morning light no longer lingers
passions rough language talked by others
retired forgotten by his brothers
on unknown ladies in the tiers
a raging torrent capped with breakers
evening and darkening sky and waters
then doors are opened Lensky enters
the choirs of dancers sought their quarters
theyre all chained up in different fetters
hed given up girls  now gave up letters
what occupied his chafing powers
printed among outmoded airs
pans mattresses and trunks and chairs
flicker of swiftly twirling pairs
a russian hammerblow repairs
a fashionplate for illustrators
another of the balldictators
watched sun and clock  then by such labours
just before dinner from his labours
defeated turned up at his neighbours
he rested  wept for by his neighbours
throughout the boredom of the hours
still dim through crystals magic glass
the moon but in the darkened glass
with the resounding chime of glass
the winters ways are smooth as glass
hell spend before the lookingglass
the only face to shake and pass
then from his cabinet hell pass
before my gaze began to pass
how pleasantly the stages pass
jaws masticate as minutes pass
no proud pretentions to success
and locked him in a dark recess
adorns Aunt Helen the princess
and from the salon the princess
and friend Evgeny the princess
the imperturbable princess
i love their feet  though I confess
in fact a thorough fop no less
we all resemble more or less
gazes at him and nonetheless
a shadow null and meaningless
with an avowal just as artless
feeling to what had long been heartless
the crush the glitter and the gladness
these days Im finding even gladness
christmas came on What joy what gladness
the atmosphere of youth and madness
i suffered once from all the madness
no all devoured by passions madness
yes youth divines in giddy madness
you age and lifes just grief and sadness
no ones I swear by God in sadness
that youthful soul which pined for sadness
at least by a regretful kindness
ive seen how trustful in his blindness
full of obedience and demureness
poetic in her simple pureness
with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
across our snows of northern bleakness
nursed in the orients languid weakness
stalking the momentary weakness
the party waits Seized with an illness
is on his feet  in utter stillness
for you i think the humble dimness
that could sustain it Only grimness
there with epigrammatic neatness
where standard rhyme are youth and fleetness
against the teas excessive sweetness
o dreams o dreams where is your sweetness
at a friends word a girls caress
bespectacled in tattered dress
the ladies calculated dress
then dress
by now hes driving home to dress
or kiss the border of her dress
a muscovite in Harolds dress
eugenes a pedant in his dress
he doesnt hear when i address
an elegy to her address
but eugenes out from din and press
no haughty stare around the press
propped in the door among the press
they all still keep their old impress
to play with a dishevelled tress
and racking with their strain and stress
his soul with murmurs of distress
tracked him and put him in duress
alas its not so hard to guess
its not in him to bring me bliss
evoke for you a sombre bliss
doubted of it so lived in bliss
shine out and bring the world to bliss
the earlier griefs are what i miss
look here as a provincial miss
the album of a country miss
can lean on faith who can dismiss
or make men seriously discuss
you criticize Moscow why make such a fuss
my tales beginning here repeats
strike the ditty up my sweets
the matchwood chatters as it lights
onegin spoke about its flights
she spins and friend of winter nights
to wave farewell the household waits
in sighs and boredom and deceits
the yard was bursting with dependants
friends foes priests guests inured attendants
lensky disliked the entertainments
but in that desert his attainments
she visited the humble tents
its glaring feasts and shrill events
in that one sound for Russian hearts
what store of riches it imparts
and on the crosses jackdaw hosts
lions adorning gateway posts
aged Derzhvin saw and blessed us
and with a smile the world caressed us
but when a later age has found us
wholl sow no calumnies around us
as when chill autumn rains surround us
whose fond attentions will astound us
a place where youll find none of us
even in novels vice entraps us
today a mental fog enwraps us
we must confess that taste deserts us
culture so far from healing hurts us
its all the same  you well correct us
but from our friends good Lord protect us
by dull eternitys purlieus
if i show wit in jesting thus
for planting cabbage like Horatius
in indolence and in rampageous
let me look back Farewell umbrageous
he was the slave of a tenacious
and in the eyes of the judicious
and now its Bordeaux the judicious
is it that weve become officious
yet hissing froth deals a malicious
to be a butt for the malicious
in rosetrimmed bonnets but malicious
i still find Gallicism delicious
ladies of riper years delicious
well go with her to that delicious
and though my muse may be capricious
too weak to change Im staying vicious
however has he earned so vicious
your heroes raging and ferocious
your battles lawless and atrocious
and whats more theyre so supercilious
so circumspect and so punctilious
and act the humble or imperious
for goodness sake you cant be serious
my task so vivid and so serious
the indifferent or the deadly serious
and my companion so mysterious
at the larins But how mysterious
in albums blunted the censorious
there was   so notorious
of useful objects that the curious
of sudden brightness its too curious
eyes rolling arms uplifted furious
or for the modishly luxurious
an attribute thats quite vexatious
attract the sneering of the jealous
convinced at heart that my most zealous
fixing an early rendezvous
o rus
the bear has raised her in his paws
no move she makes no breath she draws
at this betrayals fateful news
girl reapers as the streamlet flows
till now our language  proud God knows
yes even there its triumph grows
as fates mysterious purpose burrows
reap a brief harvest on their furrows
its newness with our faded days
those monkeys of the good old days
of moscow in the mournful days
the simple faith of olden days
right from the cradle of her days
inherited from earlier days
and rest myself from earlier days
to the beginning of our days
as the perfection of our days
that once I spent my happiest days
no every minute of my days
the comrade of so many days
sweet talk with friends How many days
sit on a flimsy bench and lays
and on her lips a light smile plays
another freakish one who stays
and on her cheeks the fever stays
such shadowy and leisured ways
of absence on my wandering ways
she blossomed in the graceful ways
what moves along the hidden ways
yes these were our forefathers ways
i shall set out on brandnew ways
but he by sad and rocky ways
for dance and din and worldly ways
oblivion of lifes stormy ways
adorning all its country ways
will blossom into splendid highways
five hundred years for sure our byways
gave up the ancient Kremlinkeys
objective of his thoughts and joys
thank you for suffering and its joys
and by the sound of silly joys
the new ballet he should be at
youre wrong But what I wonder at
the big room further not a cat
shell spin this way and that and beat
has fixed but for my heart to beat
who on a deuce that famous cheat
tsimlyansky wine between the meat
it baffles me But Ill repeat
of tanyas image Ah how great
and every plea that lips can treat
the world found this enough to treat
no forests are the sole retreat
has never staked his family seat
came driving to his country seat
fire of the cutlets scalding fat
a simile of this and that
killing each evening off like that
quickly to O I mean to that
so all went smoothly after that
he opens up a door Whats that
the gift of recognizing what
and sang me to the altarmat
in which dear friends were all afloat
the neighbour you must tell the brat
and ruled him like an autocrat
it held me captive tit for tat
by clearing every sort of debt
sent to seduce Resolve my doubt
with pleasure on his vengeful act
but held up by the simple fact
to catch the eye and to attract
you loved the opulent contact
the marriage plans were all exact
now natures tremulous pale effect
on me all this has no effect
tradition still keeps my respect
rigorously though youd inspect
and yet in her youd not detect
against each other swift small feet
are just as nimble as their feet
to clasp your knees and at your feet
of ladies heads and ladies feet
but now what brings you to my feet
of certain ladies tiny feet
and the blancmanger then a fleet
that somehow that same day well meet
not only pain too much to meet
in the salon new faces meet
and kisses smack as young girls greet
is it that she poor simple sweet
eugene as clever and quite sweet
or of Istmina my sweet
on her conquest we leave my sweet
im good for nothing now my sweet
to hear him howl thats me Youll get
who in good time would calmly get
and he remembers in the quiet
first well take vanity and let
across the stage he yawns Ballet
vintage  the year of the Comet
well draw it deeper in our net
still made of tulle the selfsame bonnet
and enviable for a poet
no magic fancies of the poet
in frosted bottle for the poet
the one who killed the youthful poet
may wind up my career as poet
i ask you each and every poet
prince who in that darkred bret
not to see Olga in a fret
after her own room makes her fret
youth which has nothing to regret
already borne down by regret
all others with a waistcoats set
then verdicts from her husbands quartet
his itching verse monsieur triquet
late of Tambov monsieur triquet
ladies who glide on waxed parquet
on ballrooms lookingglass parquet
her kindness move Tatyana yet
demanded Yes she looks And yet
and then concludes she loves him yet
before which lifes horizon yet
and watch your daughters closer yet
his foolish face more pleasant yet
blue smoke of chimneys goes aloft
shutters are opened and the soft
her nerves she leant on it her weight
get two young friends to pick a fight
in their gay glass the borrowed light
bathed in the moons inspiring light
she looks the room is getting light
the stars the moon  celestial light
in the mazurka he was light
to steal away her neighbours light
shall my sad gaze no more alight
this child of luxury and delight
they will receive us with delight
in winter was her hearts delight
tatyanad rise by candlelight
her path a hare in headlong flight
again I see your soulful flight
he drives there like a bird in flight
of distant countries of moonlight
or dim her dazzle as she might
just like a casual guest who might
would hymen bring us  blooms that might
in second place the poet might
last many a day and many a night
with visions of enchanted night
solitude stillness and the night
in the deep stillness of the night
outside and in they star the night
once more he cant await the night
seacoast to hear in dark of night
in fashions din at still of night
wakened at the same hour of night
by neva on a summer night
the happenings of the previous night
to horrorstories told at night
their hopes their pranks their dreams at night
found for its utterance that night
my early bird you know last night
a simple russian family night
converting morning to midnight
gladly So when Why not tonight
have been a fool yet hed a right
that menelaus was quite right
in first place  listen am i right
where are you come  and my own right
still everywhere the lamps are bright
saw through the window morningbright
ran through the fields sheer panic fright
you gave me such a shocking fright
tanya comes to in utter fright
come to disturb me and affright
once more at that beloved sight
may chorus when she comes in sight
should have been analysed when caught
and beat a nacreous wing when caught
blest though perhaps her fancys caught
now sweet his slumbers are distraught
repeats what her mama has taught
and your sincerity of thought
one leads the multitude in thought
and home he drives deepsunk in thought
to drain its beaker down nor thought
and prone to censure in our thought
in fact by some quite different thought
is dear to me for it has brought
of lifes repast betimes nor sought
when hourly we ourselves betrayed it
and every man wont understand it
or else or else may God forfend it
you too mamas I pray attend it
alas our youth was what we made it
the homely scene take pleasure in it
theres a small window shining in it
youre sure to find her portrait in it
their look though shows no change upon it
with censure  Ive done all to earn it
my heart awaits you you can turn it
tatyana was her name I own it
but its the first time youll have known it
i have to drag my feet to it
and when ones least prepared for it
of simple product supplements it
a nations wealth is what augments it
i dont see whats so bad about it
your modish world Ill do without it
the book displayed not so youd know it
flown from society as we know it
in your pursuit Ive come to know it
in this dear reader if you know it
the darling objects  dont you know it
and with a halting trembling gait
then crying they untwined my plait
of fallen glory Well dont wait
from day to day she could but wait
choruses Tanya can but wait
can it be true you must await
and has no knowledge of deceit
their looks and language in deceit
some minutes long The words wont fit
with trees decked in their silvery kit
and jolly magpies on the flit
with cranium aching fit to split
and with a sigh I now admit
their tendency to call and sit
finds her alone and there they sit
or languid bosoms and no visit
and good and ill and learnings fruit
in his first dream of passions fruit
of sumptuous flowers and luscious fruit
frozen in his tightfitting suit
on state affairs there was a wit
full of his usual pith and wit
darkly above the waters lilt
a simple monument is built
without a word Tatyana leant
believe as conscience is my warrant
with a sharp epigram its pleasant
what of it its euphonious pleasant
the girls attentive eyes are bent
upon it and with head downbent
the  author on  his mothers  side  is of  African  descent
where a sharp nail has made a dent
the week before lent
of rugs and carpets rich refinement
and fatherland and grim confinement
condemns the monde and its excitement
tanya looks on her own indictment
listen to me without resentment
girls often change to their contentment
smoothe his way out with humours ointment
before first light they have appointment
the rustic sage in that apartment
his housekeeper and her department
to freedom softness and enjoyment
and gave our heroine enjoyment
or from all notion of enjoyment
and in retreat from all enjoyment
and every day its own enjoyment
its work its torture its enjoyment
now crush with sorrows dull deployment
worse luck Larina crawled the employment
his young heydays supreme employment
he ended even your employment
but was it happy his employment
was it not in such sweet employment
thats where my years of youth were spent
but where are all your evenings spent
wedlock for us would be abhorrent
sweetsounding Greek names like  Agathon etc are only current
olinka and her mother sent
and as observer to be present
and yet inseparably present
active and hopeful and insistent
remains unmoved still hes persistent
there where the coulisse entrance went
goodbye onegin time i went
its right and proper that you went
poor girl to drop into a faint
but will and reasons strong constraint
what flowers of spring display your dint
madman can you forget their print
its grip on him forgot to count
unconsciously he let it mount
our deep economist had got
and satisfied with what hed got
into a small quitrent  and got
this worlds so vacuous that its got
one winters worth youve surely got
a glossary of smart argot
and i be by the world forgot
from their own country Then she shot
and just a double charge of shot
of social buzz and modish riot
and curious now about the lot
made over to them his whole lot
his serfs rejoicing at their lot
will in a flash decide his lot
husband and father as my lot
attainable But now my lot
my life in a domestic plot
without a trace of spite or plot
she roams the empty gardenplot
opens the door a tiny slot
from widow Clicquot and from mot
or borrow say from me if not
and where had he arrived from not
i acted thoughtlessly or not
by decent company has not
in everything she sees theres not
but lovely maiden wilt thou not
of the terpsichorean foot
the vital force gives them the shoot
ill save this blossom on the shoot
two pines have tangled at the root
shall not attack my lilys root
no spark of fun in all its rot
madame de Stal Bichat Tissot
to pass the evening No then tot
and cared not what his daughter kept
a young girls lookingglass is kept
now all was still Tatyana slept
by way of secret tome that slept
and sat there as the minutes crept
the world and all its works she wept
ive paid my due to classic art
but now ive rather lost the art
and fastens like a term of art
sing god knows whom compose with art
sharpness of wit and social art
and selfoblivion was his art
fly to my corner like a dart
theyd just enrage it with their dart
it lacked of course poetic heart
the blood within my withered heart
they shared their days in deed and heart
a full confession of the heart
the wilful fancies of the heart
through distant regions of the heart
my tongue kept drawing from the heart
with bursts of passion from the heart
at first disparity of heart
as if a cold hand squeezed her heart
she looked across felt in her heart
wound that had seared my Tanyas heart
one thing inspired his breath his heart
evgeny loved him from his heart
my wretched Lensky in his heart
the uncertainties within his heart
by my Eugene not for his heart
o fields  to you Im vowed at heart
to all this tattle yet at heart
in the far backwoods deepest heart
in all the world could take my heart
liven the drowsing of my heart
your grief would fail to touch my heart
im grateful now with all my heart
of hope sometimes disturbs my heart
for him the objective on lifes chart
once more the love once more the smart
despite herself rehearsed the part
was just created for the part
you took an honourable part
tatyana hears but takes no part
of sense and judgement For his part
and should have played a different part
that lensky and Eugene apart
go nurse and leave me here apart
in showing how to tell apart
the lust for blood drew them apart
and granite were so far apart
heavens will  for you Im set apart
it would be painful to depart
it may be late but its a start
in solitude as at the start
a faster stronger pulsing start
of jealousy has made her start
the wild rose blooms and in the covert
the heart of the professional flirt
or russias chondria for short
so unforgiving a report
that for all this my shames report
and to it with a grave import
one finds in war amusing sport
by some perverse schoolboy for sport
how well he knew the way to hurt
earn us the favour of the Court
and plaits a piebald shoe of bast
passion and dreams of pensive cast
dreams of inconsequential cast
and faithful wife Id have been cast
in your calche of foreign cast
in which his heros mould was cast
as wellread though of pedant cast
the two foes stand with eyes downcast
and when by misty moon the east
need not have bristled like a beast
study where he would sleep and feast
to each and every raving feast
that youthful heart But now at least
for her instruction and her breast
she sits with head sunk on her breast
she treads our earth and how her breast
anothers joy anothers breast
now as before inside my breast
the hostess cries and moving fast
with guillot while pourparlers last
onegin too good Lord at last
sorceresswinters here at last
sing about something else at last
yet he fell out of love at last
can it be true their crown at last
for the young pilgrim so at last
takes up an hour or two at last
alls well the destined hour at last
amidst the howling and the blast
has felt times desiccating blast
with sabres slash and bullets blast
drawn from a dim warmhearted past
the ardent author of the past
about whats buried in the past
after saint Charitons gone past
whether it goes careering past
to feasts and fun this winter past
he danced attendance with the best
amusing flattering with the best
in other things you come off best

if her cross mood was at its worst
nor turned a poet In the burst

her frightened cry brought running out
tanya today goes hurrying out
a sham that trustful souls work out
humbly I heard your lesson out
with that in tears and quite worn out
tatyana struggles to run out
have pushed their frontiers further out
blest the poor lover who reads out
the sumptuous palais shines out
flits Olga now tell me straight out
tatyana heard Evgeny out
onto the porch and fussed about
among the neighbours round about
weve many neighbours round about
and strip the forest round about
his dreams while she whom theyre about
blinded to everything about
with lampions studded all about
glitters with hoarfrost all about
today its turn and turn about
with deep emotion looks about

make way make way goes up the shout
she flails around she tries to shout

that like proud Byron I can draw
and still transparent to the view
ancestral portraits met the view
guillot behind a stump in view
ill say with past ideals in view
with the unmistakeable sideview
the pages of some dull review
the corsair or the Wandering jew
its nothing and away he flew
as by the shortest way they flew
of lovelorn girls was nothing new
but she for women thats not new
to us though not exactly new
the jagged flints pulled back anew
a soul that nothing can renew
at some dull aunts sat down and knew
than most Evgeny though he knew
now ive forgotten all i knew
ah all that my Onegin knew
lest signs of casual weakness drew
how to engage in talk that drew
and flown like arrows from a bow
and like an arrow from a bow
of pity in his silent bow
how can one not love mother Moscow
must now employ my pen somehow
and in his look there shows somehow
to hide a hope to make a show
already yawned before the show
and finds the world a darkling show
well talk and talk and then well show
to tanya alls an empty show
a parodistic rareeshow
that one be shot just anyhow
to olgas face he whispered low
too long hes hoaxed us high and low
and watch him stubbornly bring low
the man who laid her brother low
neighbour was sure from this would flow
of ardent speech that aching flow
he gazed out on the threatening glow
with each nuance of wintry glow
must be my theme if youll allow
and empty gossip youll allow
a classicist hell not allow
with eyes of love with greed to swallow
shes dropped her sashs silken billow
until the dawn beneath her pillow
and underneath her downy pillow
proud Albions lyre is what i follow
and with the decorous throng to follow
to see you faithfully to follow
its agony to watch the hollow
and autumn lingered long and slow
the altar flames extinguished now
why then do you pursue me now
i gave my word alas though now
reader the elder sister now
forgot its trodden path is now
maidservants on the beds just now
onegin swiftly came to know
and in the morning wouldnt know
shishkov forgive me I dont know
i only write like this you know
a cheerful glimmer on the snow
only in January the snow
and little dancing whirls of snow
and crisply crunch the morning snow
fir forest hedgehog raven snow
has painted for us the first snow
along the street lies dirty snow
having decyphered on their brow
bear blackness blizzard bridge and crow
twin lamps of serried coups throw
her clever husband on the morrow
my souls like crystal and tomorrow
as for the other one tomorrow
thank you indeed Alike in sorrow
the better to dispel her sorrow

ive run a mile I must avow

that wicked loosetongue chatterbox
of that old duellistic fox
long life to our dear friend Bordeaux
beyond a string of dull tableaux
or on the granite of the bay
id love you but inside a day
sickroom attendance night and day
onegin dyou recall the day
until the tombstone there one day
and dreamt that she with him one day
what breasts What soul Well go one day
he looks and sees the hour of day
and then indoors the livelong day
in dark attire the newborn day
the same as any other day
he was a poet in his day
id still like dances to this day
then plunged in the housekeepers day
praised his fierce courage in its day
was undiscovered to that day
with old Anisia The next day
then liking grew then every day
to fresh grandparents every day
seared as by fire she stopped today
how are your kith and kin today
yet the mazurka keeps today
tomorrow just like yesterday
the giddiest hope carefree and gay
always monotonously gay
two hearts a torch and a nosegay
alarmed by my melodious lay
or mother and in all the play
whod sit and at the end of play
to see life as a ritual play
before it was the golden play
watch the games we maidens play
struck for Evgeny with its play
tatyanas love is no byplay
when little notes come on a tray
eugene had no wish to betray
in the romantic style we say
its nothing nurse nothing i say
at my famed portrait and will say
i lack the strength required to say
onegin had no word to say
lensky had a curt word to say
for your enlightenment to say
like a sweet child Shell never say
forgotten features Can you say
visit the family what dyou say
in others houses she may say
but youre not sociable they say
to reasoned talk no dull hearsay
explodes wine fizzes up but stay
for witty in his Gallic way
wanders in a distracted way
a shambling hoof along the way
and then sat silent all the way
fail to perceive  thats by the way
jointly would tread lifes humble way
invention sparkled then gave way
to the empty homestead made her way
high time he should be on his way
just send your grandson on his way
the grand barouche is on its way
though we dont shine in any way
who late at night are whirled away
past iceblocks blue and squared away
with custom love would fade away
ive wasted too much life away
would say goodbye and drive away
sequence of dinners stretch away
his hours to dreaming them away
her grief and nearly ran away
darlings then well run away
pretty maidens romp away
looked on a river far away
an ace a dozen yards away
even if he drops or pines away
so a stormshadow wraps away
with care Zaretsky stows away
and never stir a foot away
they leave their shores and fly away
beneath storms vestment on the seaway
battling along that watery freeway
farewell you realms that own the sway
and held him briefly in their sway
stiffening as the hours go by
no word another day goes by
like mindless youth the waltz goes by
dowagers smiled as she went by
we each enjoy a special hobby
each of us has his favourite lobby
he smiled as Lensky talked the heady
and he believed his friends were ready
are almost bursting shes quite ready
why pretty one youre up already
along tverskaya Street already
but now thank God youre well and steady
to put on chains for him and steady
prevailed and with composure steady
the potholes make the coach unsteady
his mind in judgement still unsteady
actress in tragedy
pushkin leaves blank the name of Onegins model dandy
ask Tanya out to dine and they
of children though as young as they
they met on horseback quickly they
amidst the hills down in that valley
he goes ahead and parts the motley
my dear good sir Im short of money
and how a country lives and why
herself not knowing how or why
why did you visit us but why

to boom to flash across the sky
and there beneath your noonday sky

the blaze of candles and the trembly
they take her too to the Assembly
and in my soul o spring how madly
o spring o time for love how sadly
girls as they passed her spoke less loudly
and no one in the room so proudly
that languid beauty listens nicely
days when I came to flower serenely
the expanse of fields so wide so lonely
today the sad memorials lonely
is the supreme reward Precisely
pronouncing through her nose politely
my goodness how the years do fly
to captivate and then to fly
thickly the exclamations fly
as pair by pair the dancers fly
or sweeter like a butterfly
across green meadows dillydally
and read my Apuleius keenly
it all seemed new  for two days only
greyhaired and weak beneath it only
onegins life you see was holy
onegin still is slumbering deeply
by now the sun is climbing steeply
demanding when will he reply
who swaggers in with the reply
will give you a complete reply
do with her when a flat reply
to sing of others must imply
so lensky wrote obscurely limply
though whats romantic here I simply
it needs no gold if a supply
last night what made you fly so early
of finishing its book but early
but not today Although I dearly
though ill come back to him yet clearly
blest he whos left the hurlyburly
all lenskys thoughts went hurlyburly
with a quick look perusing lightly
will halt her horse and gripping tightly
lacing her stays up very tightly
the fire was dying cinders faintly
tumbled and whirled and twisted quaintly
and bliss for him is when he hotly
shes fallen in the snow  alertly
and she submissively inertly
and as the years went by who duly
to dreaming given up unduly
so she was called Tatyana truly
is represented rather truly
blest he who in his youth was truly
the rosy bloom that glowed so newly
bright summer days that passed so slowly
critical judges strict as any
onegin was assessed by many
you dont see what to do thats funny
is deep in love just like a boy
reluctant to exhaust the boy
he dandled me as a small boy
lately he married off his boy
on christmas Eve he wished me joy
treated his lessons as a ploy
brooding that is the lovers ploy
how many times I made a toy
never come and like a spy
spends light and darkness in the dreary
on features known but to that dreary
across to her consort a weary
bored with hilarity and weary
your horse bluntshoed and all unwary
the two old ladies kiss and cry
in unison repeat the cry
but tanya found she couldnt cry
all egoistical and dry
in flowers of spring its drinking dry
alas eugene beyond all query
how long hed been here was her query
have your fill of revelry
before him roast beef red and gory
fortune and dignity and glory
as sung of old in years of glory
and leave no faint footprint of glory
there didelot crowned himself with glory
to me onegin all this glory
i meant to paint with Albans glory
and pt Strasbourgs deathless glory
once more corneilles majestic story
at fifty would prolong the story
this modish whirl this social story
to high renown my doleful story
only the ode that solemn story
right at the outset of my story
but onward onward with my story
that isnt our immediate worry
now shes alarmed in desperate worry
with perturbation and with worry
he rings at once and what a scurry
she cant and in her panic hurry
and while the star still flew shed hurry
with gown and slippers tearing hurry
where in a cab and furious hurry
boredom has just as sure an entry
yes spleen was waiting like a sentry
in order daily chez vry
addressed to onegin Well thats easy
why have you gone all pale and queasy
for in our time beyond dubiety
capricious belles of grand society
but did they not corrupt society
alas on pleasures wild variety
anothers grin was sly and shifty
but in a fearful huff his thrifty
but then oblivious of the city
drive there and with formality
of oldlime hospitality
in far Moldavia fit for pity
the guests are feasted good and hearty
go off to sleep quite hale and hearty
where shall he go my rogue my hearty
is this  one sees from here the party
devote to whist an evening party
a ball here there a childrens party
youd never class her as a beauty
take olgas shoulders now  the beauty
and look serenely on your beauty
ive known too many a haughty beauty
what london calls with humble duty
inexorably wed to duty
all flourishing they send their duty
meanwhile with a dissemblers duty
