My uncle  high ideals inspire him
but when past joking he fell sick
he really forced one to admire him
and never played a shrewder trick
Let others learn from his example
But God how deadly dull to sample
sickroom attendance night and day
and never stir a foot away
And the sly baseness fit to throttle
of entertaining the halfdead
one smoothes the pillows down in bed
and glumly serves the medicine bottle
and sighs and asks oneself all through
When will the devil come for you
Such were a young rakes meditations
by will of Zeus the high and just
the legatee of his relations
as horses whirled him through the dust
Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila
without preliminary feeler
let me acquaint you on the nail
with this the hero of my tale
Onegin my good friend was littered
and bred upon the Nevas brink
where you were born as well I think
reader or where youve shone and glittered
There once I too strolled back and forth
but Im allergic to the North
After a fine career his father
had only debts on which to live
He gave three balls a year and rather
promptly had nothing left to give
Fate saved Evgeny from perdition
at first Madame gave him tuition
from her Monsieur took on the child
He was sweetnatured and yet wild
Monsieur lAbb the mediocre
reluctant to exhaust the boy
treated his lessons as a ploy
No moralizing from this joker
a mild rebuke was his worst mark
and then a stroll in Letny Park
But when the hour of youthful passion
struck for Evgeny with its play
of hope and gloom romanticfashion
it was goodbye Monsieur lAbb
Eugene was free and as a dresser
made Londons dandy his professor
His hair was fashionably curled
and now at last he saw the World
In French Onegin had perfected
proficiency to speak and write
in the mazurka he was light
his bow was wholly unaffected
The World found this enough to treat
Eugene as clever and quite sweet
We all meandered through our schooling
haphazard so to God be thanks
its easy without too much fooling
to pass for cultured in our ranks
Onegin was assessed by many
critical judges strict as any
as wellread though of pedant cast
Unforced as conversation passed
he had the talent of saluting
felicitously every theme
of listening like a judgesupreme
while serious topics were disputing
or with an epigramsurprise
of kindling smiles in ladies eyes
Now Latins gone quite out of favour
yet truthfully and not in chaff
Onegin knew enough to savour
the meaning of an epigraph
make Juvenal his text or better
add vale when he signed a letter
stumblingly call to mind he did
two verses of the Aeneid
He lacked the slightest predilection
for raking up historic dust
or stirring annalistic must
but groomed an anecdotecollection
that stretched from Romulus in his prime
across the years to our own time
He was without that dithyrambic
frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound
and telling trochee from iambic
was quite beyond his wit we found
He cursed Theocritus and Homer
in Adam Smith was his diploma
our deep economist had got
the gift of recognizing what
a nations wealth is what augments it
and how a country lives and why
it needs no gold if a supply
of simple product supplements it
His father failed to understand
and took a mortgage on his land
Evgenys total store of knowledge
I have no leisure to recall
where he was master of his college
the art hed studied best of all
his young heydays supreme employment
its work its torture its enjoyment
what occupied his chafing powers
throughout the boredom of the hours
this was the science of that passion
which Ovid sang for which the bard
condemned to a lifetime of hard
ended his wild career of fashion
deep in Moldavia the abhorred
far far from Italy his adored
IX X
How early hed learnt to dissemble
to hide a hope to make a show
of jealousy to seem to tremble
or pine persuade of yes or no
and act the humble or imperious
the indifferent or the deadly serious
In languid silence or the flame
of eloquence and just the same
in casual letters of confession
one thing inspired his breath his heart
and selfoblivion was his art
How soft his glance or at discretion
how bold or bashful there and here
how brilliant with its instant tear
How well he donned new shapes and sizes
startling the ingenuous with a jest
frightening with all despairs disguises
amusing flattering with the best
stalking the momentary weakness
with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
swaying the artless waiting on
for unmeant kindness  how he shone
then hed implore a declaration
and listen for the hearts first sound
pursue his love  and at one bound
secure a secret assignation
then afterwards alone at ease
impart such lessons as you please
How early on he learnt to trouble
the heart of the professional flirt
When out to burst a rivals bubble
how well he knew the way to hurt
what traps hed set him with what malice
hed pop the poison in his chalice
But you blest husbands to the end
you kept your friendship with our friend
the subtle spouse was just as loyal
Faublas disciple for an age
as was the old suspicious sage
and the majestic antlered royal
always contented with his life
and with his dinner and his wife
XIII XIV XV
Some days hes still in bed and drowses
when little notes come on a tray
What Invitations Yes three houses
have each asked him to a soire
a ball here there a childrens party
where shall he go my rogue my hearty
Which one comes first Its just the same
to do them all is easy game
Meanwhile attired for morning strolling
complete with broadbrimmed bolivar
Eugene attends the boulevard
and there at large he goes patrolling
until Brguets unsleeping chime
advises him of dinnertime
He mounts the sledge with daylight fading
Make way make way goes up the shout
his collar in its beaver braiding
glitters with hoarfrost all about
Hes flown to Talons calculating
that there his friend Kavrins waiting
he arrives  the cork goes flying up
wine of the Comet fills the cup
before him roast beef red and gory
and truffles which have ever been
youths choice the flower of French cuisine
and pt Strasbourgs deathless glory
sits with Limburgs vivacious cheese
and ananas the gold of trees
More wine he calls to drench the flaming
fire of the cutlets scalding fat
when Brguets chime is heard proclaiming
the new ballet he should be at
Hes off  this ruthless legislator
for the footlights this fickle traitor
to all the most adored actrices
this denizen of the coulisses
that world where every mans a critic
wholl clap an entrechat or scoff
at Cleopatra hiss her off
boo Phaedra out as paralytic
encore Mona  and rejoice
to know the audience hears his voice
Enchanted land There like a lampion
that king of the satiric scene
Fonvizin sparkled freedoms champion
and the derivative Knyazhnn
there zerov shared the unwilling
tribute of tears applauses shrilling
with young Semynova and there
our friend Katnin brought to bear
once more Corneilles majestic story
there caustic Shakhovsky came in
with comedies of swarm and din
there Didelot crowned himself with glory
there where the coulisse entrance went
thats where my years of youth were spent
My goddesses Where are you banished
lend ears to my lugubrious tone
have other maidens since you vanished
taken your place though not your throne
your chorus is it dead for ever
Russias Terpsichore shall never
again I see your soulful flight
shall my sad gaze no more alight
on features known but to that dreary
that alien scene must I now turn
my disillusioned glass and yearn
bored with hilarity and weary
and yawn in silence at the stage
as I recall a bygone age
The house is packed out scintillating
the boxes boiling pit and stalls
the gallery claps  its bored with waiting
and up the rustling curtain crawls
Then with a halfethereal splendour
bound where the magic bow will send her
Istmina thronged all around
by Naiads one foot on the ground
twirls the other slowly as she pleases
then suddenly shes off and there
shes up and flying through the air
like fluff before Aeolian breezes
shell spin this way and that and beat
against each other swift small feet
Applause Onegin enters  passes
across the publics toes he steers
straight to his stall then turns his glasses
on unknown ladies in the tiers
hes viewed the boxes without passion
hes seen it all with looks and fashion
hes dreadfully dissatisfied
to gentlemen on every side
hes bowed politely his attention
wanders in a distracted way
across the stage he yawns Ballet
they all have richly earned a pension
he turns away Ive had enough
now even Didelots tedious stuff
Still tumbling devil snake and Cupid
on stage are thumping without cease
Still in the porch exhaustedstupid
the footmen sleep on the pelisses
the audience still is busy stamping
still coughing hissing clapping champing
still everywhere the lamps are bright
outside and in they star the night
still shivering in the bitter weather
the horses fidget worse and worse
the coachmen ring the fire and curse
their lords and thwack their palms together
but Eugenes out from din and press
by now hes driving home to dress
Shall I depict with expert knowledge
the cabinet behind the door
where the prizeboy of fashions college
is dressed undressed and dressed once more
Whatever for caprice of spending
ingenious London has been sending
across the Baltic in exchange
for wood and tallow all the range
of useful objects that the curious
Parisian taste invents for one
for friends of languor or of fun
or for the modishly luxurious
all this at eighteen years of age
adorned the sanctum of our sage
Porcelain and bronzes on the table
with amber pipes from Tsaregrad
such crystalled scents as best are able
to drive the swooning senses mad
with combs and steel utensils serving
as files and scissors straight and curving
brushes on thirty different scales
brushes for teeth brushes for nails
Rousseau forgive a short distraction
could not conceive how solemn Grimm
dared clean his nails in front of him
the brilliant crackpot this reaction
shows freedoms advocate that strong
champion of rights as in the wrong
A man whos active and incisive
can yet keep nailcare much in mind
why fight whats known to be decisive
custom is despot of mankind
Dressed like   duly dreading
the barbs that envys always spreading
Eugenes a pedant in his dress
in fact a thorough fop no less
Three whole hours at the least accounting
hell spend before the lookingglass
then from his cabinet hell pass
giddy as Venus when shes mounting
a masculine disguise to aid
her progress at the masquerade
Your curiosity is burning
to hear what latest modes require
and so before the world of learning
I could describe here his attire
and though to do so would be daring
its my profession he was wearing
but pantaloons waistcoat and frock
these words are not of Russian stock
I know and seek your exculpation
that even so my wretched style
already tends too much to smile
on words of foreign derivation
though years ago I used to look
at the Academic Dictionbook
That isnt our immediate worry
wed better hasten to the ball
where in a cab and furious hurry
Onegin has outrun us all
Along the fronts of darkened houses
along the street where slumber drowses
twin lamps of serried coups throw
a cheerful glimmer on the snow
and radiate a rainbow blazing
with lampions studded all about
the sumptuous palais shines out
shadows that flit behind the glazing
project in silhouette the tops
of ladies and of freakish fops
Up to the porch our heros driven
in past concierge up marble stair
flown like an arrow then hes given
a deft arrangement to his hair
and entered Ballroom overflowing
and band already tired of blowing
while a mazurka holds the crowd
and everything is cramped and loud
spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking
dear ladies feet fly past like hail
and on their captivating trail
incendiary looks are slinking
while roar of violins contrives
to drown the hiss of modish wives
In days of carefree aspirations
the ballroom drove me off my head
the safest place for declarations
and where most surely notes are sped
You husbands deeply I respect you
Im at your service to protect you
now pay attention I beseech
and take due warning from my speech
You too mamas I pray attend it
and watch your daughters closer yet
yes focus on them your lorgnette
or else or else may God forfend it
I only write like this you know
since I stopped sinning years ago
Alas on pleasures wild variety
Ive wasted too much life away
But did they not corrupt society
Id still like dances to this day
the atmosphere of youth and madness
the crush the glitter and the gladness
the ladies calculated dress
I love their feet  though I confess
that all of Russia cant contribute
three pairs of handsome ones  yet there
exists for me one special pair
one pair I pay them memorys tribute
though cold I am and sad in sleep
the heartache that they bring lies deep
Oh when and to what desert banished
madman can you forget their print
my little feet where have you vanished
what flowers of spring display your dint
Nursed in the orients languid weakness
across our snows of northern bleakness
you left no steps that could be tracked
you loved the opulent contact
of rugs and carpets rich refinement
Was it for you that I became
long since unstirred by praise and fame
and fatherland and grim confinement
The happiness of youth is dead
just like on turf your fleeting tread
Dianas breast the cheeks of Flora
all these are charming but to put
it frankly Im a firm adorer
of the Terpsichorean foot
It fascinates by its assurance
of recompense beyond endurance
and fastens like a term of art
the wilful fancies of the heart
My love for it is just as tender
under the tables linen shield
on springtime grasses of the field
in winter on the castiron fender
on ballrooms lookingglass parquet
or on the granite of the bay
On the seashore with storm impending
how envious was I of the waves
each in tumultuous turn descending
to lie down at her feet like slaves
I longed like every breaker hissing
to smother her dear feet with kissing
No never in the hottest fire
of boiling youth did I desire
with any torture so exquisite
to kiss Armidas lips or seek
the flaming roses of a cheek
or languid bosoms and no visit
of raging passions surge and roll
ever so roughly rocked my soul
Another page of recollection
sometimes in reveries sacred land
I grasp a stirrup with affection
I feel a small foot in my hand
fancies once more are hotly bubbling
once more that touch is fiercely troubling
the blood within my withered heart
once more the love once more the smart
But now Ive praised the queens of fashion
enough of my loquacious lyre
they dont deserve what they inspire
in terms of poetry or passion
their looks and language in deceit
are just as nimble as their feet
And Eugene halfawake halfdrowsing
from ball to bed behold him come
while Petersburgs already rousing
untirable at sound of drum
the merchants up the cabmans walking
towards his stall the pedlars hawking
see with their jugs the milkgirls go
and crisply crunch the morning snow
The citys early sounds awake her
shutters are opened and the soft
blue smoke of chimneys goes aloft
and more than once the German baker
punctilious in his cotton cap
has opened up his servingtrap
Exhausted by the ballrooms clamour
converting morning to midnight
he sleeps away from glare and glamour
this child of luxury and delight
Then after midday hell be waking
his life till dawns already making
always monotonously gay
tomorrow just like yesterday
But was it happy his employment
his freedom in his youths first flower
with brilliant conquests by the shower
and every day its own enjoyment
Was it to no effect that he
at feasts was strong and fancyfree
No early on his heart was cooling
and he was bored with social noise
no not for long were belles the ruling
objective of his thoughts and joys
soon infidelity proved cloying
and friends and friendship souldestroying
not every day could he wash down
his beefsteak with champagne or drown
his Strasbourg pie or point a moral
full of his usual pith and wit
with cranium aching fit to split
and though he liked a fiery quarrel
yet he fell out of love at last
with sabres slash and bullets blast
The illness with which hed been smitten
should have been analysed when caught
something like spleen that scourge of Britain
or Russias chondria for short
it mastered him in slow gradation
thank God he had no inclination
to blow his brains out but in stead
to life grew colder than the dead
So like Childe Harold glum unpleasing
he stalked the drawingrooms remote
from Bostons cloth or gossips quote
no glance so sweet no sigh so teasing
no nothing caused his heart to stir
and nothing pierced his senses blur
XXXIX XL XLI XLII
Capricious belles of grand Society
you were the first ones he forswore
for in our time beyond dubiety
the highest circles are a bore
Its true Ill not misrepresent them
some ladies preach from Say and Bentham
but by and large their talks a hash
of the most harmless hopeless trash
And whats more theyre so supercilious
so pure so spotless through and through
so pious and so clever too
so circumspect and so punctilious
so virtuous that no sooner seen
at once they give a man the spleen
You too prime beauties in your flower
who late at night are whirled away
by drozhkies jaunting at full power
over the Petersburg pav
he ended even your employment
and in retreat from all enjoyment
locked himself up inside his den
and with a yawn took up his pen
and tried to write but a hard session
of work made him feel sick and still
no word came flowing from his quill
he failed to join that sharp profession
which I myself wont praise or blame
since Im a member of the same
Idle again by dedication
oppressed by emptiness of soul
he strove to achieve the appropriation
of others thought  a splendid goal
with shelves of books deployed for action
he read and read  no satisfaction
heres boredom madness or pretence
here theres no conscience here no sense
theyre all chained up in different fetters
the ancients have gone stiff and cold
the moderns rage against the old
Hed given up girls  now gave up letters
and hid the bookshelfs dusty stack
in taffeta of mourning black
Escaped from social rhyme and reason
retired as he from fashions stream
I was Onegins friend that season
I liked his quality the dream
which held him silently subjected
his strangeness wholly unaffected
his mind so cold and so precise
The bitterness was mine  the ice
was his wed both drunk passions chalice
our lives were flat and what had fired
both hearts to blaze had now expired
there waited for us both the malice
of blind Fortuna and of men
in lives that were just dawning then
He who has lived and thought is certain
to scorn the men with whom he deals
days that are lost behind the curtain
ghostlike must trouble him who feels
for him all sham has found rejection
hes gnawed by serpent Recollection
and by Repentance All this lends
on most occasions between friends
a great attraction to conversing
At first Onegins tongue produced
a haze in me but I grew used
to his disputing and his cursing
his virulence that made you smile
his epigrams topped up with bile
How often when the sky was glowing
by Neva on a summer night
and when its waters were not showing
in their gay glass the borrowed light
of Dians visage in our fancies
recalling earlier times romances
recalling earlier loves did we
now sensitive and now carefree
drink in the midnight benediction
the silence when our talk had ceased
Like convicts in a dream released
from gaol to greenwood by such fiction
we were swept off in reveries haze
to the beginning of our days
Evgeny stood with soul regretful
and leant upon the granite shelf
he stood there pensive and forgetful
just as the Poet paints himself
Silence was everywhere enthralling
just sentries to each other calling
and then a drozhkys clopping sound
from Million Street came floating round
and then a boat with oars aswinging
swam on the rivers dreaming face
and then with an enchanting grace
came distant horns and gallant singing
Yet sweeter far at such a time
the strain of Tassos octaverhyme
O Adrian waves my invocation
O Brenta Ill see you in dream
hear once more filled with inspiration
the magic voices of your stream
sacred to children of Apollo
Proud Albions lyre is what I follow
through it theyre known to me and kin
Italian nights when Ill drink in
your molten gold your charmed infusion
with a Venetian maiden who
can chatter and be silent too
Ill float in gondolas seclusion
from her my lips will learn and mark
the tongue of love and of Petrarch
When comes my moment to untether
its time and freedom hears my hail
I walk the shore I watch the weather
I signal to each passing sail
Beneath storms vestment on the seaway
battling along that watery freeway
when shall I start on my escape
Its time to drop astern the shape
of the dull shores of my disfavour
and there beneath your noonday sky
my Africa where waves break high
to mourn for Russias gloomy savour
land where I learned to love and weep
land where my heart is buried deep
Eugene would willingly have started
with me to see an alien strand
but soon the ways we trod were parted
for quite a while by fortunes hand
His father died and as expected
before Onegin there collected
the usurers voracious tribe
To private tastes we each subscribe
Evgeny hating litigation
and satisfied with what hed got
made over to them his whole lot
finding in that no deprivation
or else from far off he could see
old Uncles end was soon to be
In fact one day a note came flying
from the agent with this tale to tell
Uncle in bed and near to dying
wished him to come and say farewell
Evgeny read the sad epistle
and set off prompter than a whistle
as fast as posthorses could go
already yawned before the show
exercised under lucres banner
in sighs and boredom and deceits
my tales beginning here repeats
but when hed rushed to Uncles manor
a corpse on boards was all he found
an offering ready for the ground
The yard was bursting with dependants
there gathered at the coffinside
friends foes priests guests inured attendants
of every funeral far and wide
they buried Uncle congregated
to eat and drink then separated
with grave goodbyes to the bereaved
as if some goal had been achieved
Eugene turned countryman He tasted
the total ownership of woods
mills lands and waters  he whose goods
till then had been dispersed and wasted
and glad he was hed thus arranged
for his old courses to be changed
It all seemed new  for two days only
the coolness of the sombre glade
the expanse of fields so wide so lonely
the murmur where the streamlet played
the third day wood and hill and grazing
gripped him no more soon they were raising
an urge to sleep soon clear as clear
he saw that as in cities here
boredom has just as sure an entry
although there are no streets no cards
no mansions no ballrooms no bards
Yes spleen was waiting like a sentry
and dutifully shared his life
just like a shadow or a wife
No I was born for peace abounding
and country stillness there the lyre
has voices that are more resounding
poetic dreams a brighter fire
To harmless idleness devoted
on waves of far niente floated
I roam by the secluded lake
And every morning I awake
to freedom softness and enjoyment
sleep much read little and put down
the thought of volatile renown
Was it not in such sweet employment
such shadowy and leisured ways
that once I spent my happiest days
O flowers and love and rustic leisure
o fields  to you Im vowed at heart
I regularly take much pleasure
in showing how to tell apart
myself and Eugene lest a reader
of mocking turn or else a breeder
of calculated slander should
spying my features as he could
put back the libel on the table
that like proud Byron I can draw
selfportraits only  furthermore
the charge that poets are unable
to sing of others must imply
the poets only theme is I
Poets Ill say in this connection
adore the love that comes in dream
In time past objects of affection
peopled my sleep and to their theme
my soul in secret gave survival
then from the Muse there came revival
my carefree song would thus reveal
the mountain maiden my ideal
and captive girls by Salgir lying
And now my friends I hear from you
a frequent question tell me who
inspires your lute to sounds of sighing
To whom do you from all the train
of jealous girls devote its strain
Whose glance provoking inspiration
rewards the music of your mind
with fond caress whose adoration
is in your poetry enshrined
No ones I swear by God in sadness
I suffered once from all the madness
of loves anxiety Blessed is he
who can combine it with the free
fever of rhyme thereby hes doubled
poetrys sacred frenzy made
a stride on Petrarchs path allayed
the pangs with which his heart was troubled
and with it forced renown to come
but I in love was dull and dumb
Love passed the Muse appeared the weather
of mind got clarity newfound
now free I once more weave together
emotion thought and magic sound
I write my heart has ceased its pining
my thoughtless pen has stopped designing
beside unfinished lines a suite
of ladies heads and ladies feet
dead ash sets no more sparks aflying
Im grieving still but no more tears
and soon oh soon the storms arrears
will in my soul be hushed and dying
Thats when Ill sit down to compose
an ode in twentyfive cantos
Ive drawn a plan and a projection
the heros names decided too
Meanwhile my novels opening section
is finished and Ive looked it through
meticulously in my fiction
theres far too much of contradiction
but I refuse to chop or change
The censors tribute Ill arrange
Ill feed the journalists for dinner
fruits of my labour and my ink
So now be off to Nevas brink
you newborn work and like a winner
earn for me the rewards of fame
misunderstanding noise and blame

The place where Eugene loathed his leisure
was an enchanting country nook
there any friend of harmless pleasure
would bless the form his fortune took
The manor house in deep seclusion
screened by a hill from storms intrusion
looked on a river far away
before it was the golden play
of light that flowering fields reflected
villages flickered far and near
and cattle roamed the plain and here
a park enormous and neglected
spread out its shadow all around
the pensive Dryads hidingground
The chteau was of a construction
befitting such a noble pile
it stood defiant of destruction
in sensible oldfashioned style
High ceilings everywhere abounded
in the saloon brocadesurrounded
ancestral portraits met the view
and stoves with tiles of various hue
All this has now gone out of fashion
I dont know why but for my friend
interior dcor in the end
excited not a hint of passion
a modish taste a dowdy touch
both set him yawning just as much
The rustic sage in that apartment
forty years long would criticise
his housekeeper and her department
look through the pane and squash the flies
Oakfloored and simple as a stable
two cupboards one divan a table
no trace of ink no spots no stains
And of the cupboards one contains
a book of household calculations
the other jugs of applejack
fruit liqueurs and an Almanack
for  his obligations
had left the squire no time to look
at any other sort of book
Alone amid all his possessions
to pass the time was Eugenes theme
it led him in these early sessions
to institute a new regime
A thinker in a desert mission
he changed the corve of tradition
into a small quitrent  and got
his serfs rejoicing at their lot
But in a fearful huff his thrifty
neighbour was sure from this would flow
consequences of hideous woe
anothers grin was sly and shifty
but all concurred that truth to speak
he was a menace and a freak
At first they called but on perceiving
invariably as time went on
that from the backdoor hed be leaving
on a fast stallion from the Don
once on the highway hed detected
the noise their rustic wheels projected
they took offence at this and broke
relations off and never spoke
The mans a boor his brain is missing
hes a freemason too for him
red wine in tumblers to the brim
but ladies hands are not for kissing
its yes or no but never sir
The vote was passed without demur
Meanwhile another new landowner
came driving to his country seat
and in the district this persona
drew scrutiny no less complete
Vladimir Lensky whose creator
was Gttingen his alma mater
goodlooking in the flower of age
a poet and a Kantian sage
Hed brought back all the fruits of learning
from German realms of mist and steam
freedoms enthusiastic dream
a spirit strange a spirit burning
an eloquence of fevered strength
and raven curls of shoulderlength
He was too young to have been blighted
by the cold worlds corrupt finesse
his soul still blossomed out and lighted
at a friends word a girls caress
In hearts affairs a sweet beginner
he fed on hopes deceptive dinner
the worlds clat its thunderroll
still captivated his young soul
He sweetened up with fancys icing
the uncertainties within his heart
for him the objective on lifes chart
was still mysterious and enticing
something to rack his brains about
suspecting wonders would come out
He was convinced a kindred creature
would be allied to him by fate
that meanwhile pinched and glum of feature
from day to day she could but wait
and he believed his friends were ready
to put on chains for him and steady
their hand to grapple slanders cup
in his defence and smash it up
that there existed for the indulgence
of human friendship holy men
immortals picked by fate for when
with irresistible refulgence
their breed would some years after this
shine out and bring the world to bliss
Compassion yes and indignation
honest devotion to the good
bittersweet glorys inspiration
already stirred him as they should
He roamed the world his lyre behind him
Schiller and Goethe had refined him
and theirs was the poetic flame
that fired his soul to burn the same
the Muses lofty arts and fashions
fortunate one hed not disgrace
but in his songs kept pride of place
for the sublime and for the passions
of virgin fancy and again
the charm of what was grave and plain
He sang of love to love subjected
his song was limpid in its tune
as infant sleep or the unaffected
thoughts of a girl or as the moon
through heavens expanse serenely flying
that queen of secrets and of sighing
He sang of grief and partingtime
of something vague some misty clime
roses romantically blowing
of many distant lands he sang
where in the heart of silence rang
his sobs where his live tears were flowing
he sang of lifetimes yellowed page
when not quite eighteen years of age
But in that desert his attainments
only to Eugene showed their worth
Lensky disliked the entertainments
of neighbouring owners of the earth
he fled from their resounding chatter
Their talk so sound on every matter
on liquor and on hay brought in
on kennels and on kith and kin
it had no sparkle of sensation
it lacked of course poetic heart
sharpness of wit and social art
and logic yet the conversation
upon the side of the distaff
that was less clever still by half
Vladimir wealthy and goodlooking
was asked around as quite a catch
such is the usual country cooking
and all the neighbours planned a match
between their girls and this halfRussian
As soon as he appears discussion
touches obliquely but with speed
on the dull life that bachelors lead
and then its tea that comes to mention
and Dunya works the samovar
and soon they bring her a guitar
and whisper Dunya pay attention
then help me God she caterwauls
Come to me in my golden halls
Lensky of course was quite untainted
by any itch for marriage ties
instead the chance to get acquainted
with Eugene proved a tempting prize
So verse and prose they came together
No ice and flame no stormy weather
and granite were so far apart
At first disparity of heart
rendered them tedious to each other
then liking grew then every day
they met on horseback quickly they
became like brother knit to brother
Friendship as I must own to you
blooms when theres nothing else to do
But friendship as between our heroes
cant really be for weve outgrown
old prejudice all men are zeros
the units are ourselves alone
Napoleons our sole inspiration
the millions of twolegged creation
for us are instruments and tools
feeling is quaint and fit for fools
More tolerant in his conception
than most Evgeny though he knew
and scorned his fellows through and through
yet as each rule has its exception
people there were he glorified
feelings he valued  from outside
He smiled as Lensky talked the heady
perfervid language of the bard
his mind in judgement still unsteady
and always the inspired regard
to Eugene all was new and thrilling
he struggled to bite back the chilling
word on his lips and thought its sheer
folly for me to interfere
with such a blissful brief infection
even without me it will sink
but meanwhile let him live and think
the universe is all perfection
youth is a fever we must spare
its natural right to rave and flare
Between them every topic started
reflection or provoked dispute
treaties of nations long departed
and good and ill and learnings fruit
the prejudices of the ages
the secrets of the grave the pages
of fate and life each in its turn
became their scrutinys concern
In the white heat of some dissension
the abstracted poet would bring forth
fragments of poems from the North
which listening with some condescension
the tolerant Evgeny heard
but scarcely understood a word
But it was passion that preempted
the thoughts of my two anchorites
From that rough spell at last exempted
Onegin spoke about its flights
with sighs unconsciously regretful
Happy is he whos known its fretful
empire and fled it happier still
is he whos never felt its will
he who has cooled down love with parting
and hate with malice he whose life
is yawned away with friends and wife
untouched by envys bitter smarting
who on a deuce that famous cheat
has never staked his family seat
When weve retreated to the banner
of calm and reason when the flame
of passions out and its whole manner
become a joke to us its game
its wayward tricks its violent surging
its echoes its belated urging
reduced to sense not without pain
we sometimes like to hear again
passions rough language talked by others
and feel once more emotions ban
So a disabled soldierman
retired forgotten by his brothers
in his small shack will listen well
to tales that young moustachios tell
But its the talent for concealing
that ardent youth entirely lacks
hate love joy sorrow  every feeling
it blabs and spills them in its tracks
As lovingly in his confession
the poets heart found full expression
Eugene with solemn face paid heed
and felt himself loves invalide
Lensky ingenuously related
his consciences record and so
Onegin swiftly came to know
his tale of youthful love narrated
with deep emotion through and through
to us though not exactly new
Ah he had loved a love that never
is known today only a soul
that raves with poetry can ever
be doomed to feel it theres one goal
perpetually one goal for dreaming
one customary object gleaming
one customary grief each hour
not separations chilling power
no years of absence past returning
no beauties of a foreign clime
no noise of gaiety no time
devoted to the Muse or learning
nothing could alter or could tire
this soul that glowed with virgin fire
Since earliest boyhood he had doted
on Olga from hearts ache still spared
with tenderness hed watched and noted
her girlhood games in them hed shared
by deep and shady woods protected
the crown of marriage was projected
for them by fathers who as friends
and neighbours followed the same ends
Away inside that unassuming
homestead before her parents gaze
she blossomed in the graceful ways
of innocence a lily blooming
in deepest grasses quite alone
to bee and butterfly unknown
And our young poet  Olga fired him
in his first dream of passions fruit
and thoughts of her were what inspired him
to the first meanings of his flute
Farewell the games of golden childhood
he fell in love with darkest wildwood
solitude stillness and the night
the stars the moon  celestial light
to which so oft weve dedicated
those walks amid the gloom and calm
of evening and those tears the balm
of secret pain but its now rated
by judgement of the modern camp
almost as good as a dim lamp
Full of obedience and demureness
as gay as morning and as clear
poetic in her simple pureness
sweet as a lovers kiss and dear
in Olga everything expresses
the skyblue eyes the flaxen tresses
smile voice and movements little waist
take any novel clearly traced
youre sure to find her portrait in it
a portrait with a charming touch
once I too liked it very much
but now it bores me every minute
Reader the elder sister now
must be my theme if youll allow
Tatyana was her name I own it
selfwilled it may be just the same
but its the first time youll have known it
a novel graced with such a name
What of it its euphonious pleasant
and yet inseparably present
I know it in the thoughts of all
are old times and the servants hall
We must confess that taste deserts us
even in our names and how much worse
when we begin to talk of verse
culture so far from healing hurts us
what its transported to our shore
is mincing manners  nothing more
So she was called Tatyana Truly
she lacked her sisters beauty lacked
the rosy bloom that glowed so newly
to catch the eye and to attract
Shy as a savage silent tearful
wild as a forest deer and fearful
Tatyana had a changeling look
in her own home She never took
to kissing or caressing father
or mother and in all the play
of children though as young as they
she never joined or skipped but rather
in silence all day shed remain
ensconced beside the windowpane
Reflection was her friend and pleasure
right from the cradle of her days
it touched with reverie her leisure
adorning all its country ways
Her tender touch had never fingered
the needle never had she lingered
to liven with a silk atour
the linen stretched on the tambour
Sign of the urge for domination
in play with her obedient doll
the child prepares for protocol
that corps of social legislation
and to it with a grave import
repeats what her mama has taught
Tatyana had no dolls to dandle
not even in her earliest age
shed never tell them news or scandal
or novelties from fashions page
Tatyana never knew the attraction
of childish pranks a chilled reaction
to horrorstories told at night
in winter was her hearts delight
Whenever nyanya had collected
for Olga on the spreading lawn
her little friends Tatyanad yawn
shed never join the game selected
for she was bored by laughs and noise
and by the sound of silly joys
She loved the balcony the session
of waiting for the dawn to blush
when in pale sky the stars procession
fades from the view and in the hush
earths rim grows light and a forewarning
whisper of breeze announces morning
and slowly day begins to climb
In winter when for longer time
the shades of night within their keeping
hold half the world still unreleased
and when by misty moon the east
is softly indolently sleeping
wakened at the same hour of night
Tatyanad rise by candlelight
From early on she loved romances
they were her only food and so
she fell in love with all the fancies
of Richardson and of Rousseau
Her father kindly wellregarded
but in an earlier age retarded
could see no harm in books himself
he never took one from the shelf
thought them a pointless peccadillo
and cared not what his daughter kept
by way of secret tome that slept
until the dawn beneath her pillow
His wife just like Tatyana had
on Richardson gone raving mad
And not because shed read him either
and not because shed once preferred
Lovelace or Grandison or neither
but in the old days she had heard
about them  nineteen to the dozen
so often from her Moscow cousin
Princess Alina She was still
engaged then  but against her will
loved someone else not her intended
someone towards whose heart and mind
her feelings were far more inclined
this Grandison of hers was splendid
a fop a punter on the cards
and junior Ensign in the Guards
She was like him and always sported
the latest fashions of the town
but without asking they transported
her to the altar and the crown
The better to dispel her sorrow
her clever husband on the morrow
took her to his estate where she
at first with God knows whom to see
in tears and violent tossing vented
her grief and nearly ran away
Then plunged in the housekeepers day
she grew accustomed and contented
In stead of happiness say I
customs bestowed us from on high
For it was custom that consoled her
in grief that nothing else could mend
soon a great truth came to enfold her
and give her comfort to the end
she found in labours and in leisure
the secret of her husbands measure
and ruled him like an autocrat
so all went smoothly after that
Mushrooms in brine for winter eating
fieldwork directed from the path
accounts shaved forelocks Sunday bath
meantime shed give the maids a beating
if her cross mood was at its worst
but never asked her husband first
No soon she changed her old demeanour
girls albums signed in blood for choice
Praskovya rebaptized Polina
conversing in a singsong voice
lacing her stays up very tightly
pronouncing through her nose politely
the Russian N like N in French
soon all that went without a wrench
album and stays Princess Alina
sentiment notebook verses all
she quite forgot  began to call
Akulka the onetime Selina
and introduced for the last lap
a quilted chamberrobe and cap
Her loving spouse with approbation
left her to follow her own line
trusted her without hesitation
and wore his dressinggown to dine
His life went sailing in calm weather
sometimes the evening brought together
neighbours and friends in kindly group
a plain unceremonious troop
for grumbling gossiping and swearing
and for a chuckle or a smile
The evening passes and meanwhile
heres tea that Olgas been preparing
after that suppers served and so
bedtime and time for guests to go
Throughout their life so calm so peaceful
sweet old tradition was preserved
for them in Butterweek the greaseful
Russian pancakes were always served
they needed kvas like air at table
their guests for all they ate and drank
were served in order of their rank
And so they lived two ageing mortals
till he at last was summoned down
into the tombs wide open portals
and once again received a crown
Just before dinner from his labours
he rested  wept for by his neighbours
his children and his faithful wife
far more than most who leave this life
He was a good and simple barin
above the dust of his remains
the funeral monument explains
A humble sinner Dimitry Larin
beneath the stone reposes here
servant of God and Brigadier
Lensky restored to his manorial
penates came to cast an eye
over his neighbours plain memorial
and offer to that ash a sigh
sadly he mourned for the departed
Poor Yorick said he brokenhearted
he dandled me as a small boy
How many times I made a toy
of his Ochkov decoration
He destined Olgas hand for me
kept asking shall I live to see
so full of heartfelt tribulation
Lensky composed in autograph
a madrigal for epitaph
There too he honoured hotly weeping
his parents patriarchal dust
with lines to mark where they were sleeping
Alas the generations must
as fates mysterious purpose burrows
reap a brief harvest on their furrows
they rise and ripen and fall dead
others will follow where they tread
and thus our race so fluctuating
grows surges boils for lack of room
presses its forebears to the tomb
We too shall find our hour is waiting
it will be our descendants who
out of this world will crowd us too
So glut yourselves until youre sated
on this unstable life my friends
its nullity Ive always hated
I know too surely how it ends
Im blind to every apparition
and yet a distant admonition
of hope sometimes disturbs my heart
it would be painful to depart
and leave no faint footprint of glory
I never lived or wrote for praise
yet how I wish that I might raise
to high renown my doleful story
that there be just one voice which came
like a true friend to speak my name
And someones heart will feel a quiver
for maybe fortune will have saved
from drownings death in Lethe river
the strophe over which I slaved
perhaps  for flattering hope will linger
some future dunce will point a finger
at my famed portrait and will say
he was a poet in his day
I thank him without reservation
the peaceful Muses devotee
whose memory will preserve for me
the fleeting works of my creation
whose kindly hand will ruffle down
the laurel in the old mans crown

Youre off why theres a poet for you
Goodbye Onegin time I went
Well I wont hold you up or bore you
but where are all your evenings spent
At the Larins But how mysterious
For goodness sake you cant be serious
killing each evening off like that
Youre wrong But what I wonder at
is this  one sees from here the party
in first place  listen am I right
a simple Russian family night
the guests are feasted good and hearty
on jam and speeches in regard
to rains and flax and the stockyard
I dont see whats so bad about it
Boredom thats what so bad my friend
Your modish world Ill do without it
give me the homely hearth and lend
You pile one eclogue on another
for Gods sake that will do But brother
youre really going Well Im sad
Now Lensky would it be so bad
for me to glimpse this Phyllis ever
with whom your thoughts are so obsessed
pen tears and rhymes and all the rest
Present me please Youre joking Never
Gladly So when Why not tonight
They will receive us with delight
Lets go The friends all haste and vigour
drive there and with formality
are treated to the fullest rigour
of oldlime hospitality
The protocol is all one wishes
the jams appear in little dishes
on a small tables oilcloth sheen
the jug of bilberry wine is seen
And home was now their destination
as by the shortest way they flew
this was our heroes conversation
secretly overheard by you
You yawn Onegin As Im used to
This time I think youve been reduced to
new depths of boredom No the same
The fields are dark since evening came
Drive on Andryushka quicker quicker
the countrys pretty stupid here
oh  propos Larins a dear
simple old lady but the liquor
Im much afraid that bilberry wine
wont benefit these guts of mine
But tell me which one was Tatyana
She was the one who looked as still
and melancholy as Svetlana
and sat down by the windowsill
The one you loves the younger daughter
Why not Id choose the other quarter
if I like you had been a bard
Olgas no life in her regard
the roundest face that youve set eyes on
a pretty girl exactly like
any Madonna by Van Dyck
a dumb moon on a dumb horizon
Lensky had a curt word to say
and then sat silent all the way
Meanwhile the news of Eugene coming
to the Larins had caused a spout
of gossip and set comment humming
among the neighbours round about
Conjecture found unending matter
there was a general furtive chatter
and jokes and spiteful gossip ran
claiming Tatyanad found her man
and some were even testifying
the marriage plans were all exact
but held up by the simple fact
that modish rings were still abuying
Of Lenskys fate they said no more
theyd settled that some years before
Tatyana listened with vexation
to all this tattle yet at heart
in indescribable elation
despite herself rehearsed the part
the thought sank in and penetrated
she fell in love  the hour was fated
so fires of spring will bring to birth
a seedling fallen in the earth
Her feelings in their weary session
had long been wasting and enslaved
by pain and languishment she craved
the fateful diet by depression
her heart had long been overrun
her soul was waiting for someone
Tatyana now need wait no longer
Her eyes were opened and she said
this is the one Ah ever stronger
in sultry sleep in lonely bed
all day all night his presence fills her
by magic everything instils her
with thoughts of him in ceaseless round
She hates a friendly voices sound
or servants waiting on her pleasure
Sunk in dejection she wont hear
the talk of guests when they appear
she calls down curses on their leisure
and when ones least prepared for it
their tendency to call and sit
Now she devours with what attention
delicious novels laps them up
and all their ravishing invention
with sheer enchantment fills her cup
These figures from the world of seeming
embodied by the power of dreaming
the lover of Julie Wolmar
and Malek Adel de Linar
and Werther martyred and doomladen
and Grandison beyond compare
who sets me snoring then and there
all for our tender dreamy maiden
are coloured in a single tone
all blend into Eugene alone
Seeing herself as a creation
Clarissa Julie or Delphine
by writers of her admiration
Tatyana lonely heroine
roamed the still forest like a ranger
sought in her book that text of danger
and found her dreams her secret fire
the full fruit of her hearts desire
she sighed and in a trance coopted
anothers joy anothers breast
whispered by heart a note addressed
to the hero that shed adopted
But ours whatever he might be
ours was no Grandison  not he
Lending his tone a grave inflection
the ardent author of the past
showed one a pattern of perfection
in which his heros mould was cast
He gave this figure  loved with passion
wronged always in disgraceful fashion
a soul of sympathy and grace
and brains and an attractive face
Always our fervid hero tended
pure passions flame and in a trice
would launch into selfsacrifice
always before the volume ended
due punishment was handed down
to vice while virtue got its crown
Today a mental fog enwraps us
each moral puts us in a doze
even in novels vice entraps us
yes even there its triumph grows
Now that the British Muse is able
to wreck a maidens sleep with fable
the idol that shell most admire
is either the distrait Vampire
Melmoth whose roaming never ceases
Sbogar mysterious through and through
the Corsair or the Wandering Jew
Lord Byron with his shrewd caprices
dressed up a desperate egoism
to look like sad romanticism
In this dear reader if you know it
show me the sense Divine decree
may wind up my career as poet
perhaps though Phoebus warns Ill see
installed in me a different devil
and sink to proses humble level
a novel on the established line
may then amuse my glad decline
No secret crimes and no perditions
shall make my story grim as hell
no quite naively Ill retell
a Russian familys old traditions
loves melting dreams shall fill my rhyme
and manners of an earlier time
Ill catalogue each simple saying
in fathers or old uncles book
and tell of childrens plighted playing
by ancient limes or by a brook
and after jealousys grim weather
Ill part them bring them back together
Ill make them spar another round
then to the altar to be crowned
Ill conjure up that swooning fashion
of ardent speech that aching flow
of language which so long ago
facing a belle I loved with passion
my tongue kept drawing from the heart
but now Ive rather lost the art
Tatyana dear with you Im weeping
for you have at this early date
into a modish tyrants keeping
resigned disposal of your fate
Dear Tanya youre condemned to perish
but first the dreams that hope can cherish
evoke for you a sombre bliss
you learn lifes sweetness and with this
you drink the magic draught of yearning
that poison brew and in your mind
reverie hounds you and you find
shelter for trysts at every turning
in front of you on every hand
you see your fated tempter stand
Tatyana hunted by loves anguish
has made the park her broodingplace
suddenly lowering eyes that languish
too faint to stir a further pace
her bosom heaves her cheeks are staring
scarlet with passions instant flaring
upon her lips the breathing dies
noise in her ears glare in her eyes
then night comes on the moons patrolling
fardistant heavens vaulted room
a nightingale in forest gloom
sets a sonorous cadence rolling
Tatyana sleepless in the dark
makes to her nurse lowvoiced remark
I cant sleep nyanya its so stifling
open the window sit down near
Why Tanya what Alls dull and trifling
The olden days I want to hear
What of them Tanya I was able
years back to call up many a fable
I kept in mind an ancient store
of tales of girls and ghosts and lore
but now my brain is darkened Tanya
now Ive forgotten all I knew
A sorry state of things its true
My mind is fuddled Tell me nyanya
your early life unlock your tongue
were you in love when you were young
What nonsense Tanya in those other
ages wed never heard of love
why at the thought my husbands mother
had chased me to the world above
How did you come to marry nyanya
I reckon by Gods will My Vanya
was younger still but at that stage
I was just thirteen years of age
Two weeks the matchmaker was plying
to see my kin and in the end
my father blessed me So Id spend
my hours in fear and bitter crying
Then crying they untwined my plait
and sang me to the altarmat
So to strange kinsfolk I was taken
but youre not paying any heed
Oh nurse Im sad Im sad Im shaken
Im sick my dear Im sick indeed
Im near to sobbing near to weeping
Youre ill God have you in his keeping
the Lord have mercy on us all
whatever you may need just call
Ill sprinkle you with holy water
youre all in fever heavens above
Nurse Im not ill I Im in love
The Lord God be with you my daughter
and hands atremble Nyanya prayed
and put a crosssign on the maid
I am in love Tatyanas wailing
whisper repeated to the crone
My dearest heart youre sick and ailing
I am in love leave me alone
And all the while the moon was shining
and with its feeble glow outlining
the girls pale charms her loosened hair
her drops of tears and seated there
in quilted coat where rays were gleaming
on a small bench by Tanyas bed
the greyhaired nurse with kerchiefed head
and everything around was dreaming
in the deep stillness of the night
bathed in the moons inspiring light
Tatyana watched the moon and floated
through distant regions of the heart
A thought was born and quickly noted
Go nurse and leave me here apart
Give me a pen and give me paper
bring up a table and a taper
good night I swear Ill lie down soon
She was alone lit by the moon
Elbow on table spirit seething
still filled with Eugene Tanya wrote
and in her unconsidered note
all a pure maidens love was breathing
She folds the page lays down the plume
Tatyana its addressed to whom
Ive known too many a haughty beauty
cold pure as ice and as unkind
inexorably wed to duty
unfathomable to the mind
shocked by their modish pride and fleeing
the utter virtue of their being
Ive run a mile I must avow
having decyphered on their brow
hells terrifying imprecation
Abandon hope for evermore
Our love is what they most abhor
our terror is their consolation
Ladies of such a cast I think
you too have seen on Nevas brink
Thronged by adorers Ive detected
another freakish one who stays
quite selfabsorbed and unaffected
by sighs of passion or by praise
To my astonishment Ive seen her
having by her severe demeanour
frightened to death a timid love
revive it with another shove
at least by a regretful kindness
at least her tone is sometimes found
more tender than it used to sound
Ive seen how trustful in his blindness
the youthful lover once again
runs after what is sweet and vain
Why is Tatyana guiltierseeming
is it that she poor simple sweet
believes in her elected dreaming
and has no knowledge of deceit
that artless and without concealing
her love obeys the laws of feeling
that shes so trustful and imbued
by heaven with such an unsubdued
imagination with such reason
such stubborn brain and vivid will
and heart so tender it can still
burst to a fiery blaze in season
Such feckless passion  as I live
is this then what you cant forgive
The flirt has reasons cool volition
Tatyanas love is no byplay
she yields to it without condition
like a sweet child Shell never say
By virtue of procrastinating
well keep loves price appreciating
well draw it deeper in our net
first well take vanity and let
hope sting it then well try deploying
doubts to exhaust the heart then fire
jealousys flame to light desire
else having found his pleasure cloying
the cunning prisoner can quite well
at any hour escape his cell
I see another problem looming
to save the honour of our land
I must translate  theres no presuming
the letter from Tatyanas hand
her Russian was as thin as vapour
she never read a Russian paper
our native speech had never sprung
unhesitating from her tongue
she wrote in French what a confession
what can one do as said above
until this day a ladys love
in Russian never found expression
till now our language  proud God knows
has hardly mastered postal prose
They should be forced to read in Russian
I hear you say But can you see
a lady  what a grim discussion
with The WellMeaner on her knee
I ask you each and every poet
the darling objects  dont you know it
for whom to expiate your crimes
youve made so many secret rhymes
to whom your hearts are dedicated
is it not true that Russian speech
so sketchily possessed by each
by all is sweetly mutilated
and its the foreign phrase that trips
like native idiom from their lips
Protect me from such apparition
on dancefloor at breakup of ball
as bonneted Academician
or seminarist in yellow shawl
To me unsmiling lips bring terror
however scarlet free from error
of grammar Russian language too
Now to my cost it may be true
that generations of new beauties
heeding the press will make us look
more closely at the grammarbook
that verse will turn to useful duties
on me all this has no effect
tradition still keeps my respect
No incorrect and careless chatter
words mispronounced thoughts illexpressed
evoke emotions pitterpatter
now as before inside my breast
too weak to change Im staying vicious
I still find Gallicism delicious
as youthful sinning or the strains
of Bogdanvichs refrains
But thats enough My beautys letter
must now employ my pen somehow
I gave my word alas though now
a blank default would suit me better
I own it tender Parnys rhyme
is out of fashion in our time
Bard of The Feasts and hearts depression
if youd still been with me dear friend
I would have had the indiscretion
to ask of you that you transcend
in musics own bewitching fashion
the foreign words a maidens passion
found for its utterance that night
Where are you come  and my own right
with an obeisance Ill hand over
But he by sad and rocky ways
with heart thats grown unused to praise
on Finlands coast a lonely rover
he doesnt hear when I address
his soul with murmurs of distress
Tatyanas letter treasured ever
as sacred lies before me still
I read with secret pain and never
can read enough to get my fill
Who taught her an address so tender
such careless language of surrender
Who taught her all this mad slapdash
heartfelt imploring touching trash
fraught with enticement and disaster
It baffles me But Ill repeat
here a weak version incomplete
pale transcript of a vivid master
or Freischtz as it might be played
by nervous hands of a schoolmaid
Tatyanas Letter to Onegin
I write to you  no more confession
is needed nothings left to tell
I know its now in your discretion
with scorn to make my world a hell
But if youve kept some faint impression
of pity for my wretched state
youll never leave me to my fate
At first I thought it out of season
to speak believe me of my shame
youd not so much as know the name
if Id possessed the slightest reason
to hope that even once a week
I might have seen you heard you speak
on visits to us and in greeting
I might have said a word and then
thought day and night and thought again
about one thing till our next meeting
But youre not sociable they say
you find the country godforsaken
though we dont shine in any way
our joy in you is warmly taken
Why did you visit us but why
Lost in our backwoods habitation
Id not have known you therefore I
would have been spared this laceration
In time who knows the agitation
of inexperience would have passed
I would have found a friend another
and in the role of virtuous mother
and faithful wife Id have been cast
Another No another never
in all the world could take my heart
Decreed in highest court for ever
heavens will  for you Im set apart
and my whole life has been directed
and pledged to you and firmly planned
I know Godsent one Im protected
until the grave by your strong hand
youd made appearance in my dreaming
unseen already you were dear
my soul had heard your voice ring clear
stirred at your gaze so strange so gleaming
long long ago no that could be
no dream Youd scarce arrived I reckoned
to know you swooned and in a second
all in a blaze I said its he
You know its true how I attended
drank in your words when all was still
helping the poor or while I mended
with balm of prayer my torn and rended
spirit that anguish had made ill
At this midnight of my condition
was it not you dear apparition
who in the dark came flashing through
and on my bedhead gently leaning
with love and comfort in your meaning
spoke words of hope But who are you
the guardian angel of tradition
or some vile agent of perdition
sent to seduce Resolve my doubt
Oh this could all be false and vain
a sham that trustful souls work out
fate could be something else again
So let it be for you to keep
I trust my fate to your direction
henceforth in front of you I weep
I weep and pray for your protection
Imagine it quite on my own
Ive no one here who comprehends me
and now a swooning mind attends me
dumb I must perish and alone
My heart awaits you you can turn it
to life and hope with just a glance
or else disturb my mournful trance
with censure  Ive done all to earn it
I close I dread to read this page
for shame and fear my wits are sliding
and yet your honour is my gage
and in it boldly Im confiding
Now Tanyas groaning now shes sighing
the letter trembles in her grip
the rosy sealingwafers drying
upon her feverish tongue the slip
from off her charming shoulders drooping
and sideways her poor head is stooping
But now the radiance of the moon
is dimmed Down there the valley soon
comes clearer through the mists of dawning
Down there by slow degrees the stream
has taken on a silvery gleam
the herdsmans horn proclaimed the morning
and roused the village long ago
to Tanya alls an empty show
Shes paid the sunrise no attention
she sits with head sunk on her breast
over the note holds in suspension
her seal with its engraven crest
Softly the door is opened enter
grey Filatevna to present her
with a small tray and a teacup
Get up my child its time get up
Why pretty one youre up already
My early bird you know last night
you gave me such a shocking fright
but now thank God youre well and steady
your night of frettings left no trace
fresh as a poppyflower your face
Oh nurse a favour a petition
Command me darling as you choose
Now dont suppose let no suspicion
but nurse you see Oh dont refuse
My sweet God warrants me your debtor
Then send your grandson with this letter
quickly to O I mean to that
the neighbour you must tell the brat
that not a syllable be uttered
and not a mention of my name
Which neighbour dear My head became
in these last years all mixed and fluttered
Weve many neighbours round about
even to count them throws me out
How slow you are at guessing nyanya
My sweet my dearest heart Im old
Im old my mind is blunted Tanya
times were when I was sharp and bold
times were when masters least suggestion
Oh nyanya nyanya I dont question
what have your wits to do with me
Now heres a letter as you see
addressed to Onegin Well thats easy
But dont be cross my darling friend
you know Im hard to comprehend
Why have you gone all pale and queasy
Its nothing nurse nothing I say
just send your grandson on his way
Hours pass no answer waiting waiting
No word another day goes by
Shes dressed since dawn dead pale debating
demanding when will he reply
Olgas adorer comes awooing
Tell me whats your companion doing
enquired the lady of the hall
it seems that he forgot us all
Tatyana flushed and started shaking
Today he promised hed be here
so Lensky answered the old dear
the mail explains the time hes taking
Tatyana lowered her regard
as at a censure that was hard
Day faded on the table glowing
the samovar of evening boiled
and warmed the Chinese teapot flowing
beneath it vapour wreathed and coiled
Already Olgas hand was gripping
the urn of perfumed tea and tipping
into the cups its darkling stream
meanwhile a hallboy handed cream
before the window taking station
plunged in reflections deepest train
Tatyana breathed on the cold pane
and in the misted condensation
with charming forefinger she traced
OE devotedly inlaced
Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled
and tears were drowning her regard
A sudden clatter blood was curdled
Now nearer hooves and in the yard
Evgeny Ah Tatyana fleeting
light as a shadow shuns a meeting
through the back porch runs out and flies
down to the garden and her eyes
darent look behind her fairly dashing
beds bridges lawn she never stops
the alle to the lake the copse
breaking the lilac bushes smashing
parterres she runs to rivulets brink
to gasp and on a bench to sink
She dropped Its he Eugene arriving
Oh God what did he think A dream
of hope is somehow still surviving
in her torn heart  a fickle gleam
she trembles and with fever drumming
awaits him  hears nobody coming
Maidservants on the beds just now
were picking berries from the bough
singing in chorus as directed
on orders which of course presume
that thievish mouths cannot consume
their masters berries undetected
so long as theyre employed in song
such rustic cunning cant be wrong
The Song of the Girls
Maidens pretty maidens all
dear companions darling friends
pretty maidens romp away
have your fill of revelry
Strike the ditty up my sweets
ditty of our secret world
and entice a fellow in
to the circle of our dance
When we draw a fellow in
when we see him from afar
darlings then well run away
cherries then well throw at him
cherries throw and raspberries
and redcurrants throw at him
Never come and overhear
ditties of our secret world
never come and like a spy
watch the games we maidens play
They sing unmoved by their sweetsounding
choruses Tanya can but wait
listless impatient for the pounding
within her bosom to abate
and for her cheeks to cease their blushing
but wildly still her heart is rushing
and on her cheeks the fever stays
more and more brightly still they blaze
So the poor butterfly will quiver
and beat a nacreous wing when caught
by some perverse schoolboy for sport
and so in winterfields will shiver
the hare who from afar has seen
a marksman crouching in the green
But finally she heaved a yearning
sigh and stood up began to pace
she walked but just as she was turning
into the alle face to face
she found Evgeny eyes aglitter
still as a shadow grim and bitter
seared as by fire she stopped Today
I lack the strength required to say
what came from this unlookedfor meeting
my friends I need to pause a spell
and walk and breathe before I tell
a story that still wants completing
I need to rest from all this rhyme
Ill end my tale some other time

La morale est dans la nature des choses
Necker
I II III IV V VI VII
With womankind the less we love them
the easier they become to charm
the tighter we can stretch above them
enticing nets to do them harm
There was a period when coldblooded
debauchery was praised and studied
as loves technique when it would blare
its own perfection everywhere
and heartless pleasure was upgraded
yes these were our forefathers ways
those monkeys of the good old days
now Lovelaces renown has faded
as scarlet heels have lost their name
and stately periwigs their fame
How dull are acting and evasion
diversely urging the same plea
earnestly striving for persuasion
on points that all long since agree
and always the selfsame objection
how dull to work for the correction
of prejudice thats never been
harboured by maidens of thirteen
Whos not disgusted by cajoling
threats vows and simulated fears
by sixpage letters rings and tears
gossip and tricks and the patrolling
of aunts and mothers and the thrall
of husbands friendship  worst of all
Evgeny thought in just this fashion
From his first youth hed known the force
the sufferings of tempestuous passion
its winds had blown him far off course
Spoilt by the habit of indulgence
now dazzled by one things effulgence
now disenchanted with the next
more and more bored by yearnings text
bored by success giddy trifle
he heard in stillness and in din
a deathless murmur from within
found that in laughter yawns could stifle
he killed eight years in such a style
and wasted lifes fine flower meanwhile
Though belles had lost his adoration
he danced attendance with the best
rebuffed found instant consolation
deceived was overjoyed to rest
He followed them without illusion
lost them without regrets contusion
scarcely recalled their love their spite
just like a casual guest who might
devote to whist an evening party
whod sit and at the end of play
would say goodbye and drive away
go off to sleep quite hale and hearty
and in the morning wouldnt know
that selfsame evening where hed go
Yet Tanyas note made its impression
on Eugene he was deeply stirred
that virgin dream and its confession
filled him with thoughts that swarmed and whirred
the flowerlike pallor of the maiden
her look so sweetly sorrowladen
all plunged his soul deep in the stream
of a delicious guiltless dream
and though perhaps old fires were thrusting
and held him briefly in their sway
Eugene had no wish to betray
a soul so innocent so trusting
But to the garden to the scene
where Tanya now confronts Eugene
Moments of silence quite unbroken
then stepping nearer Eugene said
You wrote to me and nothing spoken
can disavow that I have read
those words where love without condition
pours out its guiltless frank admission
and your sincerity of thought
is dear to me for it has brought
feeling to what had long been heartless
but I wont praise you  let me join
and pay my debt in the same coin
with an avowal just as artless
hear my confession as I stand
I leave the verdict in your hand
Could I be happy circumscribing
my life in a domestic plot
had fortune blest me by prescribing
husband and father as my lot
could I accept for just a minute
the homely scene take pleasure in it
then Id have looked for you alone
to be the bride Id call my own
Without romance or false insistence
Ill say with past ideals in view
I would have chosen none but you
as helpmeet in my sad existence
as gage of all things that were good
and been as happy as I could
But I was simply not intended
for happiness  that alien role
Should your perfections be expended
in vain on my unworthy soul
Believe as conscience is my warrant
wedlock for us would be abhorrent
Id love you but inside a day
with custom love would fade away
your tears would flow  but your emotion
your grief would fail to touch my heart
theyd just enrage it with their dart
What sort of roses in your notion
would Hymen bring us  blooms that might
last many a day and many a night
What in the world is more distressing
than households where the wife must moan
the unworthy husband through depressing
daytimes and evenings passed alone
and where the husband recognizing
her worth but anathematising
his destiny without a smile
bursts with cold envy and with bile
For such am I When you were speaking
to me so simply with the fires
and force that purity inspires
is this the man that you were seeking
can it be true you must await
from cruel fortune such a fate
Ive dreams and years past resurrection
a soul that nothing can renew
I feel a brotherly affection
or something tenderer still for you
Listen to me without resentment
girls often change to their contentment
light dreams for new ones so we see
each springtime on the growing tree
fresh leaves for such is heavens mandate
Youll love again but you must teach
your heart some selfrestraint for each
and every man wont understand it
as I have learn from my belief
that inexperience leads to grief
So went his sermon Almost dying
blinded to everything about
by mist of tears without replying
Tatyana heard Evgeny out
He gave his arm In sad abstraction
by whats called machinal reaction
without a word Tatyana leant
upon it and with head downbent
walked homeward round the kitchen garden
together they arrived and none
dreamt of reproving what theyd done
by country freedom rightful pardon
and happy licence are allowed
as much as in Moscow the proud
Agree the way Eugene proceeded
with our poor girl was kind and good
not for the first time he succeeded
in manifesting as he could
a truly noble disposition
yet peoples malice and suspicion
persisted and made no amends
By enemies no less by friends
its all the same  you well correct us
he found all kinds of brickbat hurled
We each have enemies in this world
but from our friends good Lord protect us
Those friends those friends it is I fear
with cause that Ive recalled them here
What of it Nothing Im just sending
to sleep some black and empty dreams
but inside brackets Im contending
theres no ignoble tale that seems
cookedup where garretvermin babble
endorsed by fashionable rabble
theres no absurdity as such
no vulgar epigram too much
which smilingly your friend supported
by decent company has not
without a trace of spite or plot
a hundred times afresh distorted
yet hed back you through thick and thin
he loves you like your kith and kin
Hm hm Distinguished reader tell me
how are your kith and kin today
And here my sentiments impel me
for your enlightenment to say
how I interpret this expression
our kin are folk whom by profession
we have to cherish and admire
with all our hearts and who require
that in the usual Christmas scrimmage
we visit them or without fail
send them good wishes through the mail
to ensure that till next time our image
wont even cross their minds by stealth
God grant them years and years of health
Of course the love of tender beauties
surer than friendship or than kin
will loyally discharge its duties
in midst of trouble storm or din
Of course Yet fashions wild rotation
yet a capricious inclination
yet floods of talk around the town
the darling sex is light as down
Then verdicts from her husbands quartet
are bound by every virtuous wife
to be respected all through life
and so your faithfullest supporter
will disappear as fast as smoke
for Satan loves a splendid joke
Whom then to credit Whom to treasure
On whom alone can we depend
Who is there who will truly measure
his acts and words to suit our end
Wholl sow no calumnies around us
Whose fond attentions will astound us
Wholl never fault our vices or
whom shall we never find a bore
Dont let a ghost be your bearleader
dont waste your efforts on the air
Just let yourself be your whole care
your loved one honourable reader
Deserving object there can be
nothing more lovable than he
Then what resulted from the meeting
Alas its not so hard to guess
Loves frantic torments went on beating
and racking with their strain and stress
that youthful soul which pined for sadness
no all devoured by passions madness
poor Tanya more intensely burns
sleep runs from her she turns and turns
and health lifes sweetness and its shimmer
smiles and a maidens tranquil poise
have vanished like an empty noise
while dear Tatyanas youth grows dimmer
so a stormshadow wraps away
in dark attire the newborn day
Poor Tanyas bloom begins to languish
and pale and fade without a word
theres nothing can employ her anguish
no sound by which her soul is stirred
Neighbours in whispered tones are taking
council and with profound headshaking
conclude that its high time she wed
But thats enough At once in stead
Ill gladden your imagination
reader by painting you a scene
of happy love For I have been
too long against my inclination
held in constraint by pitys touch
I love my Tatyana too much
From hour to hour a surer capture
for Olgas beauty Lensky gives
his soul to a delicious rapture
that fills him and in which he lives
Hes always with her either seated
in darkness in her room or treated
to garden walks as arm in arm
they while away the mornings calm
What else Quite drunk with loves illusion
he even dares once in a while
emboldened by his Olgas smile
and plunged in tender shames confusion
to play with a dishevelled tress
or kiss the border of her dress
He reads to Olga on occasion
for her improvement a roman
of moralistical persuasion
more searching than Chateaubriand
but in it there are certain pages
vain twaddle fables of the ages
talk that might turn a young girls head
which with a blush he leaves unread
As far removed as they were able
from all the world they sat and pored
in deepest thought at the chessboard
for hours with elbows on the table
then Lensky moved his pawn and took
deep in distraction his own rook
Even at home his occupation
is only Olga he relieves
with careful schemes of decoration
an albums loose and floating sheaves
Sometimes a landscapes represented
a tomb a Cyprian shrines invented
a lyre and on it perched a dove
in ink with colourwash above
then on the leaves of recollection
below the others who have signed
he leaves a tender verse behind
a dreams mute monument reflection
of instant thoughts a fleeting trace
still after many years in place
Often of course youll have inspected
the album of a country miss
where scribbling friends have interjected
frontwise and back that way and this
With spelling scrambled to perdition
the unmetric verses of tradition
are entered here in friendships gage
shortened or lengthened off the page
On the first sheet youll find a question
Qucrirezvous sur ces tablettes
and under toute  vous Annette
then on the last page the suggestion
who loves you more than I lets see
him prove it writing after me
There youre entirely sure of finding
two hearts a torch and a nosegay
and there loves protestations binding
until the tombstone there one day
some regimental bard has added
a stanza villainously padded
In such an album friends I too
am always glad to write its true
convinced at heart that my most zealous
nonsense will earn indulgent looks
nor will my scribbling in such books
attract the sneering of the jealous
or make men seriously discuss
if I show wit in jesting thus
But you grand tomes I loathe with passion
odd volumes from the devils shelf
in which the rhymestermanoffashion
is forced to crucify himself
portfolios nobly illustrated
with Tolstoys brush or decorated
by Baratynskys wondrous pen
Gods thunder burn you up And when
some splendid lady is referring
to me her best inquarto tome
the fear and rage with which I foam
Deep down an epigram is stirring
that Im just longing to indite
but madrigals Ive got to write
No madrigals were for inscribing
by Lensky in his Olgas book
his style breathed love and not the gibing
coldness of wit each note he took
each news of her hed been imbibing
all was material for transcribing
with lively and pellucid look
his elegies flow like a brook
So you inspired Yazkov sobbing
with bursts of passion from the heart
sing God knows whom compose with art
a suite of elegies that throbbing
sooner or later will relate
the entire story of your fate
But soft You hear A scowling critic
bidding us to reject for good
the elegy grown paralytic
commands our rhymesterbrotherhood
oh quit your stale your tedious quacking
and your alasing and alacking
about whats buried in the past
sing about something else at last
All right you want the resurrection
of trumpet dagger mask and sword
and dead ideas from that old hoard
all brought to life at your direction
Not so No sirs the odes the thing
thats the refrain that you should sing
as sung of old in years of glory
as instituted long ago
Only the ode that solemn story
Enough my friends its all soso
Remember the retort satiric
Is Others View that clever lyric
really more bearable to you
than what our sorrowing rhymesters do
The elegys just vain protesting
empty the purpose it proclaims
while odes have high and noble aims
That point I wouldnt mind contesting
but hold my tongue lest it appears
Ill set two ages by the ears
In love with fame by freedom smitten
with storm and tumult in his head
what odes Vladimir might have written
but Olga would have never read
Bards of our tearful generation
have you read lines of your creation
to your loved ones They do maintain
that this of all things for a swain
is the supreme reward Precisely
blest the poor lover who reads out
his dreams while she whom theyre about
that languid beauty listens nicely
blest though perhaps her fancys caught
in fact by some quite different thought
But I myself read my bedizened
fancies my rhythmic search for truth
to nobody except a wizened
nanny companion of my youth
or after some dull dinners labour
I buttonhole a wandering neighbour
and in a corner make him choke
on tragedy but its no joke
when utterly worn out by rhyming
exhausted and done up I take
a rambling walk beside my lake
and duck get up with instant timing
alarmed by my melodious lay
they leave their shores and fly away
My gaze pursues them but on station
the hunter in the wood will swear
at verse and hiss an imprecation
and ease his catch with all due care
We each enjoy a special hobby
each of us has his favourite lobby
one sees a duck and aims his gun
one raves in verse like me and one
hunts cheeky flies with swatter sweeping
one leads the multitude in thought
one finds in war amusing sport
one wallows in delicious weeping
the wineaddict adores the cup
and good and bad are all mixed up
But what about Eugene With reason
reader you ask and Ill expound
craving your tolerance in season
the programme of his daily round
In summertime  for he was leading
a hermits life  hed be proceeding
on foot by seven oclock until
he reached the stream below the hill
lightly attired like the creator
of Gulnare he would play a card
out of the hand of that same bard
hed swim this Hellespont then later
hed drink his coffee flutter through
the pages of some dull review
then dress
XXXVIII XXXIX
Books riding walks sleep heavyladen
the shady wood the talking stream
sometimes from a fair blackeyed maiden
the kiss where youth and freshness gleam
a steed responsive to the bridle
and dinner with a touch of idle
fancy a wine serene in mood
tranquillity and solitude
Onegins life you see was holy
unconsciously he let it mount
its grip on him forgot to count
bright summer days that passed so slowly
forgot to think of town and friends
and tedious means to festive ends
Our evanescent northern summer
parodies winter in the south
its like a vanishing newcomer
but here we must control our mouth
The sky breathed autumn time was flowing
and good old sun more seldom glowing
the days grew shorter in the glade
with mournful sound the secret shade
was stripped away and mists encroaching
lay on the fields in caravan
the clamorous honking geese began
their southward flight one saw approaching
the season which is such a bore
November stood outside the door
Dawn comes in mist and chill no longer
do fields echo with work and shout
in pairs their hunger driving stronger
on the highroad the wolves come out
the horse gets wind of them and snorting
sets the wise traveller cavorting
up the hillside at breakneck pace
no longer does the herdsman chase
his beasts outdoors at dawn nor ringing
at noontime does his horn resound
as it assembles them around
while in the hut a girl is singing
she spins and friend of winter nights
the matchwood chatters as it lights
Hoarfrost that crackles with a will is
already silvering all the plain
the reader thinks the rhyme is lilies
here seize it quick for this quatrain
Like modish parquetry the river
glitters beneath its icingsliver
boytribes with skates on loudly slice
their joyous way across the ice
a redfoot goose weight something fearful
anticipates a swim in stead
tries out the ice with cautious tread
and skids and tumbles down the cheerful
first flakes of snow whirl round and sink
in stars upon the riverbrink
In backwoods how dyou pass this season
Walking The country that you roam
is a compulsive bore by reason
of its unvarnished monochrome
Riding on the lugubrious prairie
Your horse bluntshoed and all unwary
will find the ice elude his grip
and any moment down hell slip
Or in your lonely homestead moping
youll read heres Pradt heres Walter Scott
to pass the evening No then tot
up your accounts and raging toping
let evening pass tomorrow too
in triumph youll see winter through
ChildeHaroldlike Eugenes devoting
his hours to dreaming them away
he wakes a bath where ice is floating
and then indoors the livelong day
alone and sunk in calculation
with a blunt cue for the duration
from early morning on he will
at twoball billiards prove his skill
then country evening fast arriving
billiards are dropped cue put to bed
before the fire a tables spread
Evgeny waits and here comes driving
with three roan horses in a line
Vladimir Lensky Quick lets dine
From widow Clicquot and from Mot
the draught whose blessings are agreed
in frosted bottle for the poet
is brought to table at full speed
Bubbles like Hippocrene are spraying
once with its foaming and its playing
a simile of this and that
it held me captive tit for tat
friends recollect how I surrendered
my last poor lepton for a sup
recall by its bewitching cup
how many follies were engendered
how many lines of verse and themes
for jokes and rows and merry dreams
Yet hissing froth deals a malicious
perfidious blow to my inside
and now its Bordeaux the Judicious
that I prefer to Champagnes tide
to As vintage in the sequel
I find myself no longer equal
for mistresslike its brilliant vain
lively capricious and inane
But in misfortune or displeasure
Bordeaux youre like a faithful friend
a true companion to the end
ready to share our quiet leisure
with your good offices and so
long life to our dear friend Bordeaux
The fire was dying cinders faintly
covered the golden coal  the steam
tumbled and whirled and twisted quaintly
its barely noticeable stream
The hearth was low beyond all stoking
Straight up the chimney pipes were smoking
Still on the board the beakers hissed
and evening now drew on in mist
I like a friendly conversation
the enjoyment of a friendly drink
at hours which why I cannot think
somehow have got the designation
of time between the wolf and dog
Now hear the friends in dialogue
Tell me our neighbours are they thriving
and hows Tatyana Olga too
your dashing one is she surviving
Just half a glass more that will do
All flourishing they send their duty
Take Olgas shoulders now  the beauty
What breasts What soul Well go one day
visit the family what dyou say
if you come with me theyll be flattered
or else my friend how does it look
you called there twice and since then took
no notice of them But Ive chattered
so much Im left no time to speak
of course youre bidden there next week
I Saturday The invitation
Olinka and her mother sent
Tatyanas name day celebration
Its right and proper that you went
But therell be such a rout and scrabble
with every different kind of rabble
No no Im sure the partys small
Relations Noone else at all
Lets go our friendships worth the labour
All right Ill come then What a friend
He drained his glass down to the end
by way of toast to their fair neighbour
then he began to talk once more
of Olga loves that kind of bore
Lensky rejoiced His designated
rapture was just two weeks ahead
loves crown delectable awaited
his transports and the marriagebed
in all its mystery Hymens teasing
the pain the grief the marrowfreezing
onset of the incipient yawn
were from his vision quite withdrawn
While under the connubial banner
I can see naught as Hymens foe
beyond a string of dull tableaux
a novel in Lafontaines manner
my wretched Lensky in his heart
was just created for the part
And he was loved at least he never
doubted of it so lived in bliss
Happy a hundredfold whoever
can lean on faith who can dismiss
cold reason sleep in sensual welter
like a drunk traveller in a shelter
or sweeter like a butterfly
in flowers of spring its drinking dry
but piteous he the allforeseeing
the sober head detesting each
human reaction every speech
in the expression of its being
whose heart experience has cooled
and saved from being charmed or fooled

O never know these frightful dreams
thou my Svetlana
Zhukovsky
That year the season was belated
and autumn lingered long and slow
expecting winter nature waited
only in January the snow
night of the second started flaking
Next day Tatyana early waking
saw through the window morningbright
roofs flowerbeds fences all in white
panes patterned by the finest printer
with trees decked in their silvery kit
and jolly magpies on the flit
and hills that delicately winter
had with its brilliant mantle crowned
and glittering whiteness all around
Winter The countryman enchanted
breaks a new passage with his sleigh
his nag has smelt the snow and planted
a shambling hoof along the way
a saucy kibtka is slicing
its furrow through the powdery icing
the driver sits and cuts a dash
in sheepskin coat with scarlet sash
Here comes the yardboy who has chosen
his pup to grace the sledge while he
becomes a horse for all to see
the rogue has got a finger frozen
it hurts he laughs and all in vain
his mother taps the windowpane
But you perhaps find no attraction
in any picture of this kind
for natures unadorned reaction
has something low and unrefined
Fired by the god of inspiration
another bard in exaltation
has painted for us the first snow
with each nuance of wintry glow
hell charm you with his fine invention
hell take you prisoner youll admire
secret sledgerides in verse of fire
but Ive not got the least intention
just now of wrestling with his shade
nor his who sings of Finlands maid
Tanya profoundly Russian being
herself not knowing how or why
in Russian winters thrilled at seeing
the cold perfection of the sky
hoarfrost and sun in freezing weather
sledges and tardy dawns together
with the pink glow the snows assume
and festal evenings in the gloom
The Larins kept the old tradition
maidservants from the whole estate
would on those evenings guess the fate
of the two girls their premonition
pointed each year for time to come
at soldierhusbands and the drum
Tatyana shared with full conviction
the simple faith of olden days
in dreams and cards and their prediction
and portents of the lunar phase
Omens dismayed her with their presage
each object held a secret message
for her instruction and her breast
was by forebodings much oppressed
The tomcat mannered and affected
that sat above the stove and purred
and washed its face to her brought word
that visitors must be expected
If suddenly aloft she spied
the new moon horned on her left side
her face would pale shed start to quiver
In the dark sky a shooting star
that fell and then began to shiver
would fill Tatyana from afar
with perturbation and with worry
and while the star still flew shed hurry
to whisper it her inmost prayer
And if she happened anywhere
to meet a black monk or if crossing
her path a hare in headlong flight
ran through the fields sheer panic fright
would leave her dithering and tossing
By dire presentiment awestruck
already shed assume illluck
Yet  fear itself she found presented
a hidden beauty in the end
our disposition being invented
by nature contradictions friend
Christmas came on What joy what gladness
Yes youth divines in giddy madness
youth which has nothing to regret
before which lifes horizon yet
lies bright and vast beyond perceiving
spectacled age divines as well
although its nearly heard the knell
and all is lost beyond retrieving
no matter hope in childs disguise
is there to lisp its pack of lies
Tatyana looks with pulses racing
at sunken wax inside a bowl
beyond a doubt its wondrous tracing
foretells for her some wondrous role
from dish of water rings are shifted
in due succession hers is lifted
and at the very selfsame time
the girls sing out the ancient rhyme
The peasants there have wealth abounding
they heap up silver with a spade
and those we sing for will be paid
in goods and fame But the sadsounding
ditty portends a loss more dear
is Kit to every maidens ear
The sky is clear the earth is frozen
the heavenly lights in glorious quire
tread the calm settled path theyve chosen
Tatyana in lowcut attire
goes out into the courtyard spaces
and trains a mirror till it faces
the moon but in the darkened glass
the only face to shake and pass
is sad old moons Hark snow is creaking
a passerby and on tiptoe
she flies as fast as she can go
and whats your name she asks him speaking
in a melodious flutelike tone
He looks and answers Agafon
Prepared for prophecy and fable
she did what nurse advised she do
and in the bathhouse had a table
that night in secret set for two
then sudden fear attacked Tatyana
I too  when I recall Svetlana
Im terrified  so let it be
Tatyanas rites are not for me
Shes dropped her sashs silken billow
Tanyas undressed and lies in bed
Lel floats about above her head
and underneath her downy pillow
a young girls lookingglass is kept
Now all was still Tatyana slept
She dreamt of portents In her dreaming
she walked across a snowy plain
through gloom and mist and there came streaming
a furious boiling heaving main
across the driftencumbered acres
a raging torrent capped with breakers
a flood on which no frosty band
had been imposed by winters hand
two poles that ice had glued like plaster
were placed across the gulf to make
a flimsy bridge whose every quake
spelt hazard ruin and disaster
she stopped at the loud torrents bound
perplexed and rooted to the ground
As if before some mournful parting
Tatyana groaned above the tide
she saw no friendly figure starting
to help her from the other side
but suddenly a snowdrift rumbled
and what came out a hairy tumbled
enormous bear Tatyana yelled
the bear let out a roar and held
a sharpnailed paw towards her bracing
her nerves she leant on it her weight
and with a halting trembling gait
above the water started tracing
her way she passed then as she walked
the bear  what next  behind her stalked
A backward look is fraught with danger
she speeds her footsteps to a race
but from her shaggyliveried ranger
she cant escape at any pace
the odious bear still grunts and lumbers
Ahead of them a pinewood slumbers
in the full beauty of its frown
the branches all are weighted down
with tufts of snow and through the lifted
summits of aspen birch and lime
the nightly luminaries climb
No path to see the snow has drifted
across each bush across each steep
and all the world is buried deep
Shes in the wood the bear still trails her
Theres powdery snow up to her knees
now a protruding branch assails her
and clasps her neck and now she sees
her golden earrings off and whipping
and now the crunchy snow is stripping
her darling foot of its wet shoe
her handkerchief has fallen too
no time to pick it up  shes dying
with fright she hears the approaching bear
her fingers shake she doesnt dare
to lift her skirt up still shes flying
and he pursuing till at length
she flies no more shes lost her strength
Shes fallen in the snow  alertly
the bear has raised her in his paws
and she submissively inertly
no move she makes no breath she draws
he whirls her through the wood a hovel
shows up through trees all of a grovel
in darkest forest depths and drowned
by dreary snowdrifts piled around
theres a small window shining in it
and from within come noise and cheer
the bear explains my cousins here
come in and warm yourself a minute
he carries her inside the door
and sets her gently on the floor
Tatyana looks her faintness passes
bears gone a hallway no mistake
behind the door the clash of glasses
and shouts suggest a crowded wake
so seeing there no rhyme or reason
no meaning in or out of season
she peers discreetly through a chink
and sees whatever do you think
a group of monsters round a table
a dog with horns a goateed witch
a rooster head and on the twitch
a skeleton jerked by a cable
a dwarf with tail and a halfstrain
a hybrid cross of cat and crane
But ever stranger and more fearful
a crayfish rides on spiderback
on gooses neck a skull looks cheerful
and swaggers in a red calpack
with bended knees a windmill dances
its sails go flapflap as it prances
song laughter whistle bark and champ
and human words and horses stamp
But how she jumped when in this hovel
among the guests she recognized
the man she feared and idolized
who else  the hero of our novel
Onegin sits at table too
he eyes the door looks slyly through
He nods  they start to fuss and truckle
he drinks  all shout and take a swill
he laughs  they all begin to chuckle
he scowls  and the whole gang are still
hes host thats obvious Thus enlightened
Tanyas no longer quite so frightened
and curious now about the lot
opens the door a tiny slot
but then a sudden breeze surprises
puts out the lamps the whole brigade
of housefamiliars stands dismayed
with eyes aflame Onegin rises
from table clattering on the floor
all stand He walks towards the door
Now shes alarmed in desperate worry
Tatyana struggles to run out
she cant and in her panic hurry
she flails around she tries to shout
she cant Evgenys pushed the portal
and to the vision of those mortal
monsters the maiden stood revealed
Wildly the fearful laughter pealed
the eyes of all the hooves the snozzles
the bleeding tongues the tufted tails
the tusks the corpses fingernails
the horns and the moustachiod nozzles
all point at her and all combine
to bellow out shes mine shes mine
Shes mine Evgenys voice of thunder
clears in a flash the freezing room
the whole thieves kitchen flies asunder
the girl remains there in the gloom
alone with him Onegin takes her
into a corner gently makes her
sit on a flimsy bench and lays
his head upon her shoulder blaze
of sudden brightness its too curious
Olgas appeared upon the scene
and Lensky follows her Eugene
eyes rolling arms uplifted furious
damns the intruders Tanya lies
and almost swoons and almost dies
Louder and louder sounds the wrangle
Eugene has caught up quick as quick
a carvingknife  and in the tangle
Lenskys thrown down The murk is thick
and growing thicker then heartshaking
a scream rings out the cabins quaking
Tanya comes to in utter fright
she looks the room is getting light
outside the scarlet rays of dawning
play on the windows frosted lace
in through the door at swallows pace
pinker than glow of Northern morning
flits Olga now tell me straight out
who was it that you dreamt about
Deaf to her sisters intervention
Tatyana simply lay in bed
devoured a book with rapt attention
and kept quite silent while she read
The book displayed not so youd know it
no magic fancies of the poet
no brilliant truth no vivid scene
and yet by Vergil or Racine
by Scott by Seneca or Byron
even by Ladies Fashion Post
no one was ever so engrossed
Martin Zadka was the siren
dean of Chaldeas learned team
archcommentator of the dream
This work of the profoundest learning
was brought there by a huckster who
one day came down that lonely turning
and to Tanya when he was through
swapped it for odd tomes of Malvina
but just to make the bargain keener
he charged three roubles and a half
and took two Petriads in calf
a grammar a digest of fable
and volume three of Marmontel
Since then Martin Zadkas spell
bewitches Tanya he is able
to comfort her in all her woes
and every night shares her repose
Tatyanas haunted by her vision
plagued by her ghastly dream and tries
to puzzle out with some precision
just what the nightmare signifies
Searching the table exegetic
she finds in order alphabetic
bear blackness blizzard bridge and crow
fir forest hedgehog raven snow
etcetera But her trepidation
Martin Zadka fails to mend
the horrid nightmare must portend
a hideous deal of tribulation
For several days she peaked and pined
in deep anxiety of mind
But now Auroras crimson fingers
from daybreak valleys lift the sun
the morning light no longer lingers
the festal name day has begun
Since dawn whole families have been driving
towards the Larins and arriving
in sledded coaches and coups
in britzkas kibtkas and sleighs
The hall is full of noise and hustle
in the salon new faces meet
and kisses smack as young girls greet
theres yap of pugs and laughs and bustle
the thresholds thronged wetnurses call
guests bow feet scrape and children squall
Here with his wife that bulging charmer
fat Pstyakov has driven in
Gvozdn exemplary farmer
whose serfs are miserably thin
and the Skotnins grizzled sages
with broods of children of all ages
from thirty down to two and stop
heres Petushkv the local fop
and look my cousins come Buynov
in a peaked cap all dust and fluff
youll recognize him soon enough
and counsellor retired Flynov
that rogue backbiter pantaloon
bribetaker glutton and buffoon
Here in his red peruke and glasses
late of Tambov Monsieur Triquet
has come with Kharlikov he passes
for witty in his Gallic way
inside a pocket Triquet nurses
addressed to Tanya certain verses
set to wellknown childrens glee
rveillezvous belle endormie
He found them in some old collection
printed among outmoded airs
Triquet ingenious poet dares
to undertake their resurrection
and for belle Nina as it read
hes put belle Tatiana instead
And from the nearby Army station
the Majors here hes all the rage
with our Mamas and a sensation
with demoiselles of riper age
his news has set the party humming
the regimental band is coming
sent at the Colonels own behest
A ball the joy of every guest
Young ladies jump for future blisses
But dinners served so two by two
and arm in arm they all go through
round Tanya congregate the misses
the men confront them face to face
they sit they cross themselves for grace
They buzz  but then all talks suspended
jaws masticate as minutes pass
the crash of plates and knives is blended
with the resounding chime of glass
And now theres gradually beginning
among the guests a general dinning
none listens when the others speak
all shout and argue laugh and squeak
Then doors are opened Lensky enters
Onegin too Good Lord at last
the hostess cries and moving fast
the guests squeeze closer to the centres
they shove each plate and every chair
and shout and make room for the pair
Just facing Tanyas where theyre sitting
and paler than the moon at dawn
she lowers darkened eyes unwitting
and trembles like a hunted fawn
From violent passions fast pulsating
shes nearly swooned shes suffocating
the friends salute she never hears
and from her eyes the eager tears
are almost bursting shes quite ready
poor girl to drop into a faint
but will and reasons strong constraint
prevailed and with composure steady
she sat there through her teeth a word
came out so soft it scarce was heard
The nervoustragical reaction
girls tears their swooning for Eugene
had long proved tedious to distraction
he knew too well that sort of scene
Now faced with this enormous revel
hed got annoyed the tricky devil
He saw the sad girls trembling state
looked down in an access of hate
pouted and swore in furious passion
to wreak by stirring Lenskys ire
the best revenge one could desire
Already in exultant fashion
he watched the guests and as he dined
caricatured them in his mind
Tanyas distress had risked detection
not only by Evgenys eye
but looks and talk took the direction
that moment of a luscious pie
alas too salted now theyre bringing
bottles to which some pitch is clinging
Tsimlyansky wine between the meat
and the blancmanger then a fleet
of goblets tall and slender pretties
how they remind me of your stem
Zizi my crystal and my gem
you object of my guileless ditties
with draughts from loves enticing flask
you made me drunk as one could ask
Freed from its dripping cork the bottle
explodes wine fizzes up but stay
solemn too long compelled to throttle
his itching verse Monsieur Triquet
is on his feet  in utter stillness
the party waits Seized with an illness
of swooning Tanya nearly dies
and scroll in hand before her eyes
Triquet sings out of tune Loud clapping
and cheers salute him Tanya must
thank him by curtseying to the dust
great bard despite his modest trapping
hes first to toast her in the bowl
then he presents her with the scroll
Compliment and congratulation
Tanya thanks each one with a phrase
When Eugenes turn for salutation
arrives the girls exhausted gaze
her discomposure her confusion
expose his soul to an intrusion
of pity in his silent bow
and in his look there shows somehow
a wondrous tenderness And whether
it was that hed been truly stirred
or halfunwittingly preferred
a joking flirt or both together
there was a softness in his glance
it brought back Tanya from her trance
Chairs are pushed outward loudly rumbling
and all into the salon squeeze
as from their luscious hive go tumbling
fieldward in noisy swarm the bees
The banquets given no cause for sneezing
neighbours in high content are wheezing
ladies at the fireside confer
in corners whispering girls concur
now by green tablecloths awaited
the eager players are enrolled
Boston and ombre for the old
and whist thats now so keenly fted
pursuits of a monotonous breed
begot by boredom out of greed
By now whists heroes have completed
eight rubbers and by now eight times
theyve moved around and been reseated
and teas brought in Instead of chimes
I like to tell the time by dinner
and tea and supper theres an inner
clock in the country rings the hour
no fuss our belly has the power
of any Brguet and in passing
Ill just remark my verses talk
as much of banquets and the cork
and eatables beyond all classing
as yours did Homer godlike lord
whom thirty centuries have adored
XXXVII
At feasts though full of pert aggression
I put your genius to the test
I make magnanimous confession
in other things you come off best
your heroes raging and ferocious
your battles lawless and atrocious
your Zeus your Cypris your whole band
have clearly got the upper hand
of Eugene cold as all creation
of plains where boredom reigns complete
or of Istmina my sweet
and all our modish education
but your vile Helens not my star
no Tanyas more endearing far
No one will think that worth gainsaying
though Menelaus in Helens name
may spend a century in flaying
the hapless Phrygians all the same
and although Troys greybeards collected
around Priam the muchrespected
may chorus when she comes in sight
that Menelaus was quite right
and Paris too But hear my pleading
as battles go Ive not begun
dont judge the race before its run
be good enough to go on reading
therell be a fight For that I give
my word no welshing as I live
Heres tea the girls have just as bidden
taken the saucers in their grip
when from behind the doorway hidden
bassoons and flutes begin to trip
Elated by the musics blaring
Petushkv local Paris tearing
his tea with rum quite left behind
approaches Olga Lenskys signed
Tatyana on Miss Kharlikova
that nubile maid of riper age
is seized by Tambovs poetsage
Buynov whirls off Pustyakova
they all have swarmed into the hall
and in full brilliance shines the ball
Right at the outset of my story
if youll turn back to chapter one
I meant to paint with Albans glory
a ball in Petersburg but fun
and charming reveries vain deflection
absorbed me in the recollection
of certain ladies tiny feet
Enough Ive wandered in the suite
of your slim prints though this be treason
to my young days its time I turned
to wiser words and deeds and learned
to demonstrate some signs of reason
let no more such digressions lurk
in this fifth chapter of my work
And now monotonously dashing
like mindless youth the waltz goes by
with spinning noise and senseless flashing
as pair by pair the dancers fly
Revenges hour is near and after
Evgeny full of inward laughter
has gone to Olga swept the girl
past all the assembly in a whirl
he takes her to a chair beginning
to talk of this and that but then
after two minutes off again
theyre on the dancefloor waltzing spinning
All are dumbfounded Lensky shies
away from trusting his own eyes
Now the mazurka sounds Its thunder
used in times past to ring a peal
that huge ballrooms vibrated under
while floors would split from crash of heel
and frames would shudder windows tremble
now things are changed now we resemble
ladies who glide on waxed parquet
Yet the mazurka keeps today
in country towns and suchlike places
its pristine charm heeltaps and leaps
and whiskers  all of this it keeps
as fresh as ever for its graces
are here untouched by fashions reign
our modern Russias plague and bane
Petushkvs nails and spurs are sounding
that halfpay archivist and bounding
Buynovs heels have split the wood
and wrecked the flooringboards for good
theres crashing rumbling pounding trotting
the deeper in the wood the more
the logs the wild ones have the floor
theyre plunging whirling all but squatting
Ah gently gently easy goes
your heels will squash the ladies toes
Buynov my vivacious cousin
leads Olga and Tatyana on
to Eugene nineteen to the dozen
Eugene takes Olga and is gone
he steers her nonchalantly gliding
he stoops and tenderly confiding
whispers some ballad of the hour
squeezes her hand  and brings to flower
on her smug face a flush of pleasure
Lensky has watched his rage has blazed
hes lost his selfcommand and crazed
with jealousy beyond all measure
insists when the mazurka ends
on the cotillion as amends
He asks She cant accept Why ever
No shes already pledged her word
to Evgeny Oh God shed never
How could she why hed never heard
scarce out of bibs already fickle
fresh from the cot an infant pickle
already studying to intrigue
already high in treasons league
He finds the shock beyond all bearing
so cursing womens devious course
he leaves the house calls for his horse
and gallops Pistols made for pairing
and just a double charge of shot
will in a flash decide his lot

Seeing Vladimir had defected
Eugene at Olgas side was racked
by fresh ennui as he reflected
with pleasure on his vengeful act
Olinka yawned just like her neighbour
and looked for Lensky while the labour
of the cotillions endless theme
oppressed her like a heavy dream
Its over Supper is proceeding
Beds are made up the guests are all
packed from the maids wing to the hall
Each one by now is badly needing
a place for rest Eugene alone
has driven off to find his own
All sleep from the saloon a roaring
proclaims where ponderous Pstyakov
beside his heavier half is snoring
Gvozdn Buynov Petushkv
and Flynov amply lubricated
on diningchairs are all prostrated
the floor serves Triquet for his nap
in flannel and an old fur cap
In the two sisters rooms extended
the maidens all are slumbering deep
Only Tatyana does not sleep
but at the window in the splendid
radiance of Dian sits in pain
and looks out on the darkened plain
His unexpected apparition
the fleeting tenderness that stole
into his look the exhibition
with Olga all have pierced her soul
she cant make out a single fraction
of his intent and a reaction
of jealousy has made her start
as if a cold hand squeezed her heart
as if beneath her dark and rumbling
a gulf has gaped Says Tanya I
am doomed to perish yet to die
through him is sweetness self In grumbling
I find no sense the truth is this
its not in him to bring me bliss
But onward onward with my story
A new acquaintance claims our quill
Five versts or so from Krasnogrie
Lenskys estate there lives and still
thrives to this moment in a station
of philosophic isolation
Zartsky sometime king of brawls
and hetman of the gamblinghalls
archrake pothouse tribunepersona
but now grown plain and kind in stead
paterfamilias unwed
unswerving friend correct landowner
and even honourable man
so if we want to change we can
The world of fashion prone to flatter
praised his fierce courage in its day
true with a pistol he could shatter
an ace a dozen yards away
its also true in battles rapture
the circumstances of his capture
had made his name when bold as bold
down from his Kalmuck steed he rolled
into the mud a drunken goner
and taken by the French  some prize
resigned himself to prisons ties
like Regulus that god of honour
in order daily chez Vry
to drain on credit bottles three
Time was hed been the wittiest ever
so brilliantly hed hoax the fools
so gloriously hed fool the clever
using overt or covert rules
Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble
or cause the bursting of his bubble
sometimes hed fall into a trap
himself just like a simple chap
But he could draw a joking moral
return an answer blunt or keen
use cunning silence as a screen
or cunningly create a quarrel
get two young friends to pick a fight
and put them on a pacedout site
Or he knew how to reconcile them
so that all three went off to lunch
then later slyly hed revile them
with lies and jokes that packed a punch
sed alia tempora The devil
like passions dream that other revel
goes out of us when youth is dead
So my Zaretsky as I said
beneath birdcherries and acacias
has found a port for his old age
and lives a veritable sage
for planting cabbage like Horatius
and breeding ducks and geese as well
and teaching children how to spell
He was no fool appreciated
by my Eugene not for his heart
but for the effect that he created
of sense and judgement For his part
his converse gave Onegin pleasure
so it was not in any measure
the morning after a surprise
when our Zaretsky met his eyes
His visitor from the beginning
broke greetings off and gave Eugene
a note from Lensky in between
Zaretsky watched and stood there grinning
Onegin without more ado
crossed to the window read it through
Pleasant in spite of its compression
gentlemanly quite precise
Vladimirs challenge found expression
that though polite was clear as ice
Eugenes response was automatic
he informed this envoy diplomatic
in terms where not a word was spared
at any time hed be prepared
Zaretsky rose without discussion
he saw no point in staying on
with work at home but when hed gone
Evgeny whom the repercussion
left quite alone with his own soul
was far from happy with his role
With reason too for when hed vetted
in secret judgement what hed done
he found too much that he regretted
last night hed erred in making fun
so heartless and so detrimental
of love so timorous and gentle
In second place the poet might
have been a fool yet hed a right
at eighteen years to some compassion
Evgeny loved him from his heart
and should have played a different part
no softball for the winds of fashion
no boy to fight or take offence
the man of honour and of sense
He could have spoken without harming
need not have bristled like a beast
he should have settled for disarming
that youthful heart But now at least
its late times passing not to mention
in our affair the intervention
of that old duellistic fox
that wicked loosetongue chatterbox
True scorn should punish and should bridle
his wit according to the rules
but whispers the guffaw of fools
Public opinion  heres our idol
the spring of honour and the pin
on which the world is doomed to spin
Lensky at home awaits the answer
impatient hatred flaming high
but here comes our loudtalking prancer
who swaggers in with the reply
The jealous poets gloom is lightened
knowing the offender hed been frightened
lest he should by some clever trick
avert his chest from pistols click
smoothe his way out with humours ointment
But now Vladimirs doubts are still
early tomorrow at the mill
before first light they have appointment
to raise the safety catch and strain
to hit the target thigh or brain
Still blazing with resentments fuel
and set on hating the coquette
Lensky resolved before the duel
not to see Olga in a fret
watched sun and clock  then by such labours
defeated turned up at his neighbours
He thought that Olgad be confused
struck down as if shed been accused
when he arrived not in the slightest
just as shed always been she tripped
to meet the unhappy poet skipped
down from the porch light as the lightest
the giddiest hope carefree and gay
the same as any other day
Last night what made you fly so early
was the first thing that Olga said
All Lenskys thoughts went hurlyburly
and silently he hung his head
Rage died and jealousys obsession
before such candour of expression
such frank tendresse away they stole
before such playfulness of soul
he looks in sweet irresolution
and then concludes she loves him yet
Already borne down by regret
he almost begs for absolution
he trembles knows not what to tell
hes happy yes hes almost well
XV XVI XVII
Now brooding thoughts hold his attention
once more at that beloved sight
and so he lacks the strength to mention
the happenings of the previous night
he murmurs Olgas mine for saving
Ill stop that tempter from depraving
her youth with all his repertoire
of sighs and compliments and fire
that poisonous worm despised degrading
shall not attack my lilys root
Ill save this blossom on the shoot
still hardly opened up from fading
Friends all this meant was Ive a date
for swapping bullets with my mate
If only Lenskyd known the burning
wound that had seared my Tanyas heart
If Tanyad had the chance of learning
that Lensky and Eugene apart
would settle on the morrow morning
for which of them the tomb was yawning
perhaps her love could in the end
have reunited friend to friend
But even by accident her passion
was undiscovered to that day
Onegin had no word to say
Tatyana pined in secret fashion
of the whole world her nurse alone
if not slowwitted might have known
Lensky all evening in distraction
would talk keep silent laugh then frown
the quintessential reaction
of Muses offspring sitting down
before the clavichord with knitted
forehead he strummed his vision flitted
to Olgas face he whispered low
I think Im happy Time to go
the hour was late And now from aching
the heart inside him seemed to shrink
parting with Olga made him think
it was quite torn in half and breaking
She faced him questioning But you
Its nothing And away he flew
Once home he brought out and inspected
his pistols laid them in their case
undressed by candlelight selected
and opened Schiller but the embrace
of one sole thought holds him in keeping
and stops his doleful heart from sleeping
Olga is there he sees her stand
in untold beauty close at hand
Vladimir shuts the book for writing
prepares himself and then his verse
compact of amorous trash and worse
flows and reverberates Reciting
he sounds in lyric frenzy sunk
like Delvig when hes dining drunk
By chance those verses havent vanished
I keep them and will quote them here
Whither oh whither are ye banished
my golden days when spring was dear
What fate is my tomorrow brewing
the answers past all human viewing
its hidden deep in gloom and dust
No matter fates decree is just
Whether the arrow has my number
whether it goes careering past
alls well the destined hour at last
comes for awakening comes for slumber
blessed are daytimes care and cark
blest is the advent of the dark
The morning star will soon be shining
and soon will days bright tune be played
but I perhaps will be declining
into the tombs mysterious shade
the trail the youthful poet followed
by sluggish Lethe may be swallowed
and I be by the world forgot
but lovely maiden wilt thou not
on my untimely urn be weeping
thinking he loved me and in strife
the sad beginnings of his life
he consecrated to my keeping
Friend of my heart be at my side
beloved friend thou art my bride
So Lensky wrote obscurely limply
in the romantic style we say
though whats romantic here I simply
fail to perceive  thats by the way
At last with dawn upon him stooping
his weary head and softly drooping
over the modish word ideal
he dozed away but when the real
magic of sleep had started claiming
its due oblivion in the hush
his neighbour entered at a rush
and wakened Lensky by exclaiming
Get up its gone six Ill be bound
Onegins waiting on the ground
But hes mistaken Eugenes lying
and sleeping sounder than a rock
By now the shades of night are flying
Vesper is met by crow of cock
Onegin still is slumbering deeply
By now the sun is climbing steeply
and little dancing whirls of snow
glitter and tumble as they go
but Eugene hasnt moved for certain
slumber still floats above his head
At last he wakes and stirs in bed
and parts the fringes of his curtain
he looks and sees the hour of day
high time he should be on his way
He rings at once and what a scurry
his French valet Guillot is there
with gown and slippers tearing hurry
as linens brought for him to wear
And while with all despatch hes dressing
he warns his man for duty stressing
that with him to the trystingplace
he has to bring the battlecase
By now the sledge is at the portal
hes racing millward like a bird
Arrived apace he gives the word
to bring across Lepages mortal
barrels and then to drive aside
by two small oaktrees in a ride
While Lenskyd long been meditating
impatiently on the milldam
Zaretsky engineerinwaiting
condemned the millstones as a sham
Onegin comes and makes excuses
but in Zaretsky he induces
amazement Wheres your second gone
In duels a pedantic don
methodical by disposition
a classicist hell not allow
that one be shot just anyhow
only by rule and strict tradition
inherited from earlier days
for which he must receive due praise
Evgeny echoed him My second
Hes here  Monsieur Guillot my friend
I had most surely never reckoned
his choice could shock or might offend
though hes unknown theres no suggestion
that hes not honest past all question
Zaretsky bit his lip Eugene
asked Lensky Should we start I mean
Vladimir to this casual mention
replies We might as well They walk
behind the mill In solemn talk
Zaretsky draws up a convention
with Guillot while pourparlers last
the two foes stand with eyes downcast
Foes Is it long since from each other
the lust for blood drew them apart
long since like brother linked to brother
they shared their days in deed and heart
their table and their hours of leisure
But now in this vindictive pleasure
hereditary foes they seem
and as in some appalling dream
each coldly plans the others slaughter
could they not laugh out loud before
their hands are dipped in scarlet gore
could they not give each other quarter
and part in kindness Just the same
all modish foes dread worldly shame
Pistols are out they gleam the hammer
thumps as the balls are pressed inside
faceted muzzles by the rammer
with a first click the catch is tried
Now powders greyish stream is slipping
into the pan Securely gripping
the jagged flints pulled back anew
Guillot behind a stump in view
stands in dismay and indecision
And now the two opponents doff
their cloaks Zaretskys measured off
thirtytwo steps with great precision
and on their marks has made them stand
each grips his pistol in his hand
Now march And calmly not yet seeking
to aim at steady even pace
the foes coldblooded and unspeaking
each took four steps across the space
four fateful stairs Then without slowing
the level tenor of his going
Evgeny quietly began
to lift his pistol up A span
of five more steps they went slowgaited
and Lensky left eye closing aimed
but just then Eugenes pistol flamed
The clock of doom had struck as fated
and the poet without a sound
let fall his pistol on the ground
Vladimir drops hand softly sliding
to heart And in his misted gaze
is death not pain So gently gliding
down slopes of mountains when a blaze
of sunlight makes it flash and crumble
a block of snow will slip and tumble
Onegin drenched with sudden chill
darts to the boy and looks and still
calls out his name All unavailing
the youthful votary of rhyme
has found an end before his time
The storm is over dawn is paling
the bloom has withered on the bough
the altar flames extinguished now
He lay quite still and strange as dreaming
was that calm brow of one who swooned
Shot through below the chest  and streaming
the blood came smoking from the wound
A moment earlier inspiration
had filled this heart and detestation
and hope and passion life had glowed
and blood had bubbled as it flowed
but now the mansion is forsaken
shutters are up and all is pale
and still within behind the veil
of chalk the windowpanes have taken
The lady of the house has fled
Where to God knows The trail is dead
With a sharp epigram its pleasant
to infuriate a clumsy foe
and as observer to be present
and watch him stubbornly bring low
his thrusting horns and as he passes
blush to descry in lookingglasses
his foolish face more pleasant yet
to hear him howl thats me Youll get
more joy still when with mute insistence
you help him to an honoured fate
by calmly aiming at his pate
from any gentlemanly distance
but when youve managed his despatch
you wont find that quite so much catch
What if your pistolshot has smitten
a friend of yours in his first youth
because some glance of his has bitten
your pride some answer or in truth
some nonsense thrown up while carousing
or if himself with rage arousing
hes called you out  say in your soul
what feelings would assume control
if motionless no life appearing
death on his brow your friend should lie
stiffening as the hours go by
before you on the ground unhearing
unspeaking too but stretched out there
deaf to the voice of your despair
Giving his pistolbutt a squeezing
Evgeny looks at Lensky chilled
at heart by grim remorses freezing
Well what the neighbour says hes killed
Killed At this frightful word aquiver
Onegin turns and with a shiver
summons his people On the sleigh
with care Zaretsky stows away
the frozen corpse drives off and homing
vanishes with his load of dread
The horses as they sense the dead
have snorted reared and whitely foaming
have drenched the steel bit as they go
and flown like arrows from a bow
My friends the bard stirs your compassion
right in the flower of joyous hope
hope that hes had no time to fashion
for men to see still in the scope
of swaddling clothes  already blighted
Where is the fire that once ignited
wheres the high aim the ardent sense
of youth so tender so intense
and where is loves tempestuous yearning
where are the reveries this time
the horror of disgrace and crime
the thirst for work the lust for learning
and life celestials phantom gleams
stuff of the poets hallowed dreams
Perhaps to improve the worlds condition
perhaps for fame he was endowed
his lyre now stilled in its high mission
might have resounded long and loud
for aeons Maybe it was fated
that on the worlds staircase there waited
for him a lofty stair His shade
after the martyrs price it paid
maybe bore off with it for ever
a secret truth and at our cost
a lifecreating voice was lost
to it the peoples blessing never
will reach and past the tombs compound
hymns of the ages never sound
XXXVIII XXXIX
Perhaps however to be truthful
he would have found a normal fate
The years would pass no longer youthful
hed see his soul cool in its grate
his nature would be changed and steadied
hed sack the Muses and get wedded
and in the country blissful horned
in quilted dressinggown adorned
lifes real meaning would have found him
at forty hed have got the gout
drunk eaten yawned grown weak and stout
at length midst children swarming round him
midst crones with endless tears to shed
and doctors hed have died in bed
Reader whatever fates direction
we weep for the young lovers end
the man of reverie and reflection
the poet struck down by his friend
Lefthanded from the habitation
where dwelt this child of inspiration
two pines have tangled at the root
beneath a brook rolls its tribute
toward the neighbouring valleys river
The ploughman there delights to doze
girl reapers as the streamlet flows
dip in their jugs where shadows quiver
darkly above the waters lilt
a simple monument is built
Below it when sprang rains are swishing
when on the plain green herbs are massed
the shepherd sings of Volgas fishing
and plaits a piebald shoe of bast
and the young citybred newcomer
who in the country spends her summer
when galloping at headlong pace
alone across the fields of space
will halt her horse and gripping tightly
the leather rein to learn the tale
lift up the gauzes of her veil
with a quick look perusing lightly
the simple legend  then a haze
of tears will cloud her tender gaze
Walking her horse in introspection
across the plains enormous room
what holds her in profound reflection
despite herself is Lenskys doom
Olga she thinks what fate befell her
her heartache did it long compel her
or did her grief soon find repair
and wheres her sister now and where
flown from society as we know it
of modish belles the modish foe
where did that glum eccentric go
the one who killed the youthful poet
All in good time on each point I
will give you a complete reply
But not today Although I dearly
value the hero of my tale
though Ill come back to him yet clearly
to face him now I feel too frail
The years incline to gloom and prosing
they kill the zest of rhymed composing
and with a sigh I now admit
I have to drag my feet to it
My pen as once no longer hurries
to spoil loose paper by the ream
another a more chilling dream
and other more exacting worries
in fashions din at still of night
come to disturb me and affright
Ive learnt the voice of new ambition
Ive learnt new sadness but in this
the first will never find fruition
the earlier griefs are what I miss
O dreams o dreams where is your sweetness
where standard rhyme are youth and fleetness
can it be true their crown at last
has felt times desiccating blast
can it be true and firmly stated
without an elegiac frill
that spring with me has had its fill
as Ive so oft in jest related
Can it be true it wont come twice
and Ill be thirty in a trice
Well I must make a frank confession
my noon is here and thats the truth
So let me with a kind expression
take leave of my lightheaded youth
Thank you for all the gifts I treasure
thank you for sorrow and for pleasure
thank you for suffering and its joys
for tempests and for feasts and noise
thank you indeed Alike in sorrow
and in flat calm Ive found the stuff
of perfect bliss in you Enough
My souls like crystal and tomorrow
I shall set out on brandnew ways
and rest myself from earlier days
Let me look back Farewell umbrageous
forests where my young age was passed
in indolence and in rampageous
passion and dreams of pensive cast
But come thou youthful inspiration
come trouble my imagination
liven the drowsing of my heart
fly to my corner like a dart
let not the poets soul of passion
grow cold and hard and stiff as stock
and finally be turned to rock
amid the deadening joys of fashion
amongst the soulless men of pride
the fools who sparkle far and wide
amongst the crafty and smallminded
the children spoilt the mad the rogues
both dull and ludicrous the bunded
critics and their capricious vogues
amongst devout coquettes appalling
lickspittles who adore their crawling
and daily scenes of modish life
where civil treacheries are rife
urbane betrayals and the chilling
verdicts of vanity the bleak
mens thoughts their plots the words they speak
all of an emptiness so killing
thats the morass I beg you note
in which dear friends were all afloat

By now the rays of spring are chasing
the snow from all surrounding hills
it melts away it rushes racing
down to the plain in turbid rills
Smiling through sleep nature is meeting
the infant year with cheerful greeting
the sky is brilliant in its blue
and still transparent to the view
the downy woods are greenertinted
from waxen cell the bees again
levy their tribute on the plain
the vales dry out grow brightly printed
cows low in the still nights of spring
the nightingales begun to sing
O spring o time for love how sadly
your advent swamps me in its flood
and in my soul o spring how madly
your presence aches and in my blood
How heavy and how near to sobbing
the bliss that fills me when your throbbing
caressing breath has fanned my face
in rural calms most secret place
Or from all notion of enjoyment
am I estranged does all that cheers
that lives and glitters and endears
now crush with sorrows dull deployment
a soul that perished long ago
and finds the world a darkling show
Or unconsoled by the returning
of leaves that autumn killed for good
are we recalled to grief still burning
by the new whisper in the wood
or else does nature fresh and staring
set off our troubled mind comparing
its newness with our faded days
with years no more to meet our gaze
Perhaps when thoughts are all aquiver
in midst of a poetic dream
some other older spring will gleam
and put our heart into a shiver
with visions of enchanted night
of distant countries of moonlight
Its time kindhearted idle creatures
dons of Epicurean rule
calm men with beatific features
graduates of the Levshin school
Priamlike agricultural sages
sensitive ladies of all ages
the spring invites you to the land
now warmth and blossom are on hand
fieldwork and walks with inspiration
and magic nights In headlong course
come to the fields my friends To horse
With mounts from home or postal station
in loaded carriages migrate
leave far behind that citygate
Forsake indulgent reader  driven
in your calche of foreign cast
the untiring city where youve given
to feasts and fun this winter past
and though my muse may be capricious
well go with her to that delicious
and nameless rivulet that scene
of whispering woods where my Eugene
an idle monk in glum seclusion
has lately wintered just a space
from young Tatyanas dwellingplace
dear Tanya lover of illusion
though there hes no more to be found
hes left sad footprints on the ground
Amidst the hills down in that valley
lets go where winding all the time
across green meadows dillydally
a brook flows through a grove of lime
There sings the nightingale springs lover
the wild rose blooms and in the covert
the sources chattering voice is heard
and there a tombstone says its word
where two old pinetrees stand united
This is Vladimir Lenskys grave
who early died as die the brave
the headpiecetext is thus indited
the year his age then may your rest
young poet be for ever blest
There was a pinebranch downward straying
towards the simple urn beneath
time was when mornings breeze was swaying
over it a mysterious wreath
time was in evening hours of leisure
by moonlight two young girls took pleasure
closely embraced in wending here
to see the grave and shed a tear
Today the sad memorials lonely
forgot Its trodden path is now
choked up Theres no wreath on the bough
greyhaired and weak beneath it only
the shepherd as he used to do
sings as he plaits a humble shoe
VIII IX X
Poor Lensky Set aside for weeping
or pining Olgas hours were brief
Alas for him there was no keeping
his sweetheart faithful to her grief
Another had the skill to ravish
her thoughts away knew how to lavish
sweet words by which her pain was banned
a Lancer wooed and won her hand
a Lancer  how she deified him
and at the altar with a crown
her head in modesty cast down
already there she stands beside him
her eyes are lowered but ablaze
and on her lips a light smile plays
Poor Lensky where the tomb is bounded
by dull eternitys purlieus
was the sad poet not confounded
at this betrayals fateful news
Or as by Lethes bank he slumbered
perhaps no more sensations lumbered
the lucky bard and as he dozed
the earth for him grew dumb and closed
On such indifference such forgetting
beyond the grave we all must build
foes friends and loves their voice is stilled
Only the estate provides a setting
for angry heirs as one to fall
into an unbecoming brawl
Presently Olgas ringing answer
inside the Larins house fell mute
Back to his regiment the Lancer
slave of the service was en route
Weltered in tears and sorely smarting
the old dame wept her daughters parting
and in her grief seemed fit to die
but Tanya found she couldnt cry
only the pallor of heartbreaking
covered her face When all came out
onto the porch and fussed about
over the business of leavetaking
Tatyana went with them and sped
the carriage of the newlywed
And long as if through mists that spurted
Tanya pursued them with her gaze
So there she stood forlorn deserted
The comrade of so many days
oh her young dove the natural hearer
of secrets like a friend but dearer
had been for ever borne off far
and parted from her by their star
Shadelike in purposeless obsession
she roams the empty gardenplot
in everything she sees theres not
a grain of gladness tears repression
allows no comfort to come through
Tatyanas heart is rent in two
Her passion burns with stronger powder
now shes bereft and just the same
her heart speaks to her even louder
of faraway Onegins name
Shell not see him her obligation
must be to hold in detestation
the man who laid her brother low
The poets dead already though
no one recalls him or his verses
by now his bridetobe has wed
another and his memorys fled
as smoke in azure sky disperses
Two hearts there are perhaps that keep
a tear for him but whats to weep
Evening and darkening sky and waters
in quiet flood A beetle whirred
The choirs of dancers sought their quarters
Beyond the stream there smoked and stirred
a fishers fire Through country gleaming
silver with moonlight in her dreaming
profoundly sunk Tatyana stalked
for hours alone she walked and walked
Suddenly from a crest she sighted
a house a village and a wood
below a hill a garden stood
above a stream the moon had lighted
She looked across felt in her heart
a faster stronger pulsing start
She hesitates and doubts beset her
forward or back its true that he
has left and no one here has met her
The house the park Ill go and see
So down came Tanya hardly daring
to draw a breath around her staring
with puzzled and confused regard
She entered the deserted yard
Dogs howling rushed in her direction
Her frightened cry brought running out
the household boys in noisy rout
giving the lady their protection
by dint of cuff and kick and smack
they managed to disperse the pack
Could I just see the house I wonder
Tatyana asked The children all
rushed to Anisias room to plunder
the keys that opened up the hall
At once Anisia came to greet her
the doorway opened wide to meet her
she went inside the empty shell
in which our hero used to dwell
She looks forgotten past all chalking
on billiardtable rests a cue
and on the crumpled sofa too
a riding whip Tanya keeps walking
And heres the hearth explains the crone
where master used to sit alone
Here in the winter hed have dinner
with neighbour Lensky the deceased
Please follow me And heres the inner
study where he would sleep and feast
on cups of coffee and then later
hed listen to the administrator
in morning time hed read a book
And just here in the windownook
is where old master took up station
and put his glasses on to see
his Sunday game of cards with me
I pray God grant his soul salvation
and rest his dear bones in the tomb
down in our damp earthmothers womb
Tatyana in a deep emotion
gazes at all the scene around
she drinks it like a priceless potion
it stirs her drooping soul to bound
in fashion thats halfglad halfanguished
that table where the lamp has languished
beside the windowsill that bed
on which a carpet has been spread
piled books and through the pane the sable
moonscape the halflight overall
Lord Byrons portrait on the wall
the iron figure on the table
the hat the scowling brow the chest
where folded arms are tightly pressed
Longtime inside this modish cloister
as if spellbound Tatyana stands
Its late A breeze begins to roister
the valleys dark The forest lands
round the dim river sleep the curtain
of hills has hid the moon for certain
the time to go has long since passed
for the young pilgrim So at last
Tatyana hiding her condition
and not without a sigh perforce
sets out upon her homeward course
before she goes she seeks permission
to come back to the hall alone
and read the books there on her own
Outside the gate Tatyana parted
with old Anisia The next day
at earliest morning out she started
to the empty homestead made her way
then in the studys quiet setting
at last alone and quite forgetting
the world and all its works she wept
and sat there as the minutes crept
the books then underwent inspection
at first she had no heart to range
but then she found their choice was strange
To reading from this odd collection
Tatyana turned with thirsting soul
and watched a different world unroll
Though long since Eugenes disapproval
had ruled out reading in their place
and still exempted from removal
a few books had escaped disgrace
Don Juans and the Giaours creator
two or three novels where our later
epochs portrayed survived the ban
works where contemporary man
is represented rather truly
that soul without a moral tie
all egoistical and dry
to dreaming given up unduly
and that embittered mind which boils
in empty deeds and futile toils
There many pages keep the impression
where a sharp nail has made a dent
On these with something like obsession
the girls attentive eyes are bent
Tatyana sees with trepidation
what kind of thought what observation
had drawn Eugenes especial heed
and where hed silently agreed
Her eyes along the margin flitting
pursue his pencil Everywhere
Onegins soul encountered there
declares itself in ways unwitting
terse words or crosses in the book
or else a querys wondering hook
And so at last feature by feature
Tanya begins to understand
more thoroughly thank God the creature
for whom her passion has been planned
by fates decree this freakish stranger
who walks with sorrow and with danger
whether from heaven or from hell
this angel this proud devil tell
what is he Just an apparition
a shadow null and meaningless
a Muscovite in Harolds dress
a modish secondhand edition
a glossary of smart argot
a parodistic rareeshow
Can she have found the enigmas setting
is this the riddles missing clue
Time races and shes been forgetting
her journey home is overdue
Some neighbours there have come together
they talk of her of how and whether
Tanyas no child  its past a joke
says the old lady in a croak
why Olgas younger and shes bedded
Its time she went But what can I
do with her when a flat reply
always comes back Ill not be wedded
And then she broods and mopes for good
and trails alone around the wood
Shes not in love Theres no one ever
Buynov tried  got flea in ear
And Ivan Petushkv no never
Pikhtn of the Hussars was here
he found Tatyana so attractive
bestirred himself was devilish active
I thought shell go this time perhaps
far from it just one more collapse
You dont see what to do thats funny
Moscows the place the marriagefair
Theres vacancies in plenty there
My dear good sir Im short of money
One winters worth youve surely got
or borrow say from me if not
The old dame had no thought of scouring
such good and sensible advice
accounts were done a winter outing
to Moscow settled in a trice
Then Tanya hears of the decision
To face societys derision
with the unmistakeable sideview
of a provincial ingnue
to expose to Moscow fops and Circes
her outoffashion turns of phrase
parade before their mocking gaze
her outoffashion clothes oh mercies
no forests are the sole retreat
where her securitys complete
Risen with earliest rays of dawning
Tanya today goes hurrying out
into the fields surveys the morning
with deep emotion looks about
and says Farewell you vales and fountains
farewell you too familiar mountains
Farewell familiar woods Farewell
beauty with all its heavenly spell
gay nature and its sparkling distance
This dear still world I must forswear
for vanity and din and glare
Farewell to you my free existence
whither does all my yearning tend
my fate it leads me to what end
She wanders on without direction
Often she halts against her will
arrested by the sheer perfection
she finds in river and in hill
As with old friends she craves diversion
in gossips rambling and discursion
with her own forests and her meads
But the swift summertime proceeds
now golden autumns just arriving
Now Natures tremulous pale effect
suggests a victim richly decked
The north wind blows the clouds are driving
amidst the howling and the blast
sorceresswinters here at last
Shes here she spreads abroad she stipples
the branches of the oak with flock
lies in a coverlet that ripples
across the fields round hill and rock
the bank the immobile stream are levelled
beneath a shroud thats all dishevelled
frost gleams We watch with gleeful thanks
old mother winter at her pranks
Only from Tanyas heart no cheering
for her no joy from wintertime
she wont inhale the powdered rime
nor from the bathhouse roof be clearing
first snow for shoulders breast and head
for Tanya winters ways are dread
Departure dates long overtaken
at last the final hours arrive
A sledded coach for years forsaken
relined and strengthened for the drive
three carts  traditional procession
with every sort of home possession
pans mattresses and trunks and chairs
and jam in jars and household wares
and featherbeds and birds in cages
with pots and basins out of mind
and useful goods of every kind
Theres din of parting now that rages
with tears in quarters of the maids
and in the yard stand eighteen jades
Horses and coach are spliced in marriage
the cooks prepare the midday meal
mountains are piled on every carriage
and coachmen swear and women squeal
The bearded outrider is sitting
his spindly shaggy nag As fitting
to wave farewell the household waits
for the two ladies at the gates
Theyre settled in and crawling sliding
the grand barouche is on its way
Farewell you realms that own the sway
of solitude and peace abiding
shall I see you As Tanya speaks
the tears in stream pour down her cheeks
When progress and amelioration
have pushed their frontiers further out
in time to quote the calculation
of philosophic brains about
five hundred years for sure our byways
will blossom into splendid highways
paved roads will traverse Russias length
bringing her unity and strength
and iron bridges will go arching
over the waters in a sweep
mountains will part below the deep
audacious tunnels will be marching
Godfearing folk will institute
an inn at each stage of the route
But now our roads are bad the ages
have gnawed our bridges and the flea
and bedbug that infest the stages
allow no rest to you or me
inns dont exist but in a freezing
log cabin a pretentiousteasing
menu hung up for show excites
all sorts of hopeless appetites
meanwhile the local Cyclops aiming
a Russian hammerblow repairs
Europes most finely chiselled wares
before a fire too slowly flaming
and blesses the unrivalled brand
of ruts that grace our fatherland
By contrast in the frozen season
how pleasantly the stages pass
Like modish rhymes that lack all reason
the winters ways are smooth as glass
Then our Automedons are flashing
our troikas effortlessly dashing
and mileposts grip the idle sense
by flickering past us like a fence
Worse luck Larina crawled the employment
of her own horses not the post
spared her the expense she dreaded most
and gave our heroine enjoyment
of travellers tedium at its peak
their journey took them a full week
But now theyre near Already gleaming
before their eyes they see unfold
the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming
with fire from every cross of gold
Friends how my heart would leap with pleasure
when suddenly I saw this treasure
of spires and belfries in a cup
with parks and mansions open up
How often would I fall to musing
of Moscow in the mournful days
of absence on my wandering ways
Moscow how many strains are fusing
in that one sound for Russian hearts
what store of riches it imparts
Here stands with shady park surrounded
Petrovsky Castle and the fame
in which so lately it abounded
rings proudly in that sombre name
Napoleon here intoxicated
with recent fortune vainly waited
till Moscow meekly on its knees
gave up the ancient Kremlinkeys
but no my Moscow never stumbled
nor crawled in suppliant attire
No feast no welcomegifts  with fire
the impatient conqueror was humbled
From here deepsunk in pensive woe
he gazed out on the threatening glow
Farewell Petrovsky Castle glimmer
of fallen glory Well dont wait
drive on And now we see ashimmer
the pillars of the turnpikegate
along Tverskaya Street already
the potholes make the coach unsteady
Street lamps go flashing by and stalls
boys country women stately halls
parks monasteries towers and ledges
Bokharans orchards merchants shacks
boulevards chemists and Cossacks
peasants and fashionshops and sledges
lions adorning gateway posts
and on the crosses jackdaw hosts
XXXIX XL
This wearisome perambulation
takes up an hour or two at last
the coach has reached its destination
after Saint Charitons gone past
a mansion stands just round a turning
On an old aunt whos long been burning
with a consumption theyve relied
And now the door is opened wide
a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them
bespectacled in tattered dress
and from the salon the princess
stretched on a sofa calls to greet them
The two old ladies kiss and cry
thickly the exclamations fly
Princess mon ange Pachette Alina
Who would have thought it What an age
How long can you  Dearest kuzina
Sit down how strange its like the stage
or else a novel And my daughter
Tatyanas here you know Ive brought her
Ah Tanya come to me it seems
Im wandering in a world of dreams
Grandison cousin dyou remember
What Grandison oh Grandison
I do I do Well wheres he gone
Here near Saint Simeon in December
on Christmas Eve he wished me joy
lately he married off his boy
As for the other one tomorrow
well talk and talk and then well show
Tanya to all her kin My sorrow
is that my feet lack strength to go
outside the house But youll be aching
after your drive its quite backbreaking
lets go together take a rest
Oh Ive no strength Im tired my chest
These days Im finding even gladness
not only pain too much to meet
Im good for nothing now my sweet
you age and lifes just grief and sadness
With that in tears and quite worn out
she burst into a coughingbout
The invalids glad salutation
her kindness move Tatyana yet
the strangeness of her habitation
after her own room makes her fret
No sleep beneath that silken curtain
in that new couch no sleep for certain
the early pealing of the bells
lifts her from bed as it foretells
the occupations of the morning
She sits down by the windowsill
The darkness thins away but still
no vision of her fields is dawning
An unknown yard she sees from thence
a stall a kitchen and a fence
The kinsfolk in concerted action
ask Tanya out to dine and they
present her languor and distraction
to fresh grandparents every day
For cousins from afar on meeting
there never fails a kindly greeting
and exclamations and good cheer
How Tanyas grown I pulled your ear
just yesterday And since your christening
how long is it And since I fed
you in my arms on gingerbread
And all grandmothers who are listening
in unison repeat the cry
My goodness how the years do fly
Their look though shows no change upon it
they all still keep their old impress
still made of tulle the selfsame bonnet
adorns Aunt Helen the princess
still powdered is Lukrya Lvovna
a liar still Lyubv Petrovna
Ivn Petrvich still is dumb
Semyn Petrvich mean and glum
and then old cousin Pelagya
still has Monsieur Finemouche for friend
same Pom same husband to the end
hes at the club a real stayer
still meek still deaf as howdyoudo
still eats and drinks enough for two
And in their daughters close embraces
Tanya is gripped No comments made
at first by Moscows youthful graces
while shes from top to toe surveyed
they find her somewhat unexpected
a bit provincial and affected
too pale too thin but on the whole
not bad at all and then each soul
gives way to natures normal passion
shes their great friend asked in caressed
her hands affectionately pressed
they fluff her curls out in the fashion
and in a singsong voice confide
the inmost thoughts that girls can hide
Each others and their own successes
their hopes their pranks their dreams at night
and so the harmless chat progresses
coated with a thin layer of spite
Then in return for all this twaddle
from her they strive to coax and coddle
a full confession of the heart
Tatyana hears but takes no part
as if shed been profoundly sleeping
theres not a word shes understood
she guards in silence and for good
her sacred store of bliss and weeping
as something not to be declared
a treasure never to be shared
To talk to general conversation
Tatyana seeks to attune her ear
but the salons preoccupation
is with dull trash that cant cohere
everythings dim and unenthusing
even the scandals not amusing
in talk so fruitless and so stale
in question gossip news and tale
not once a day a thought will quiver
not even by chance once in a while
will the benighted reason smile
even in joke the heart wont shiver
This worlds so vacuous that its got
no spark of fun in all its rot
In swarms around Tatyana ranging
the modish Record Office clerks
stare hard at her before exchanging
some disagreeable remarks
One melancholy fop declaring
that shes ideal begins preparing
an elegy to her address
propped in the door among the press
Once Vyzemsky who chanced to find her
at some dull aunts sat down and knew
how to engage in talk that drew
her souls attention just behind her
an old man saw her as she came
straightened his wig and asked her name
But where mid tragic storms that rend her
Melpomene wails long and loud
and brandishes her tinsel splendour
before a cold indifferent crowd
and where Thalia gently napping
ignores approvals friendly clapping
and where Terpsichore alone
moves the young watcher as was known
to happen long ago dear readers
in our first ages from no place
did any glasses seek her face
lorgnettes of jealous fashionleaders
or quizzingglasses of knowalls
in boxes or the rows of stalls
They take her too to the Assembly
The crush the heat as music blares
the blaze of candles and the trembly
flicker of swiftly twirling pairs
the beauties in their flimsy dresses
the swarm the glittering mob that presses
the ring of marriageable girls
bludgeon the sense it faints and whirls
Here insolent prizedandies wither
all others with a waistcoats set
and an insouciant lorgnette
Hussars on leave are racing hither
to boom to flash across the sky
to captivate and then to fly
The night has many stars that glitter
Moscow has beauties and to spare
but brighter than the heavenly litter
the moon in its azure of air
And yet that goddess whom Id never
importune with my lyre whenever
like a majestic moon she drives
among the maidens and the wives
how proudly how divinely gleaming
she treads our earth and how her breast
is in voluptuous languor dressed
how sensuously her eyes are dreaming
Enough I tell you that will do
youve paid insanity its due
Noise laughter bowing helterskelter
galop mazurka waltz Meanwhile
between two aunts in pillared shelter
unnoticed in unseeing style
Tanya looks on her own indictment
condemns the monde and its excitement
she finds it stifling here she strains
in dream toward the woods and plains
the country cottages and hovels
and to that far and lonely nook
where flows a little glittering brook
to her flowergarden to her novels
to where he came to her that time
in twilight of alles of lime
But while she roams in thought not caring
for dance and din and worldly ways
a general of majestic bearing
has fixed on her a steady gaze
The aunts exchanged a look they fluttered
they nudged Tatyana and each muttered
at the same moment in her ear
Look quickly to the left dyou hear
Look to the left where whats the matter
There just in front of all that swarm
you see the two in uniform
just look and never mind the chatter
hes moved you see him from the side
Who that fat general Tanya cried
But here with our congratulation
on her conquest we leave my sweet
Im altering my destination
lest in forgetfulness complete
I drop my hero Ill be truthful
It is a friend I sing a youthful
amateur of caprice and quirk
Muse of the epic bless my work
in my long task be my upholder
put a strong staff into my hand
dont let me stray in paths unplanned
Enough The load is off my shoulder
Ive paid my due to classic art
it may be late but its a start

Fare thee well and if for ever
Still for ever fare thee well
Byron
Days when I came to flower serenely
in Lyce gardens long ago
and read my Apuleius keenly
but spared no glance for Cicero
yes in that springtime in lowlying
secluded vales where swans were crying
by waters that were still and clear
for the first time the Muse came near
And suddenly her radiance lighted
my student cell she opened up
the joys of youth that festal cup
she sang of childhoods fun indited
Russias old glories and their gleams
the heart and all its fragile dreams
And with a smile the world caressed us
what wings our first successes gave
aged Derzhvin saw and blessed us
as he descended to the grave
The arbitrary rules of passion
were all the law that I would use
sharing her in promiscuous fashion
I introduced my saucy Muse
to roar of banquets din of brawling
when night patrols a perilous calling
to each and every raving feast
she brought her talents never ceased
Bacchantelike her flighty prancing
sang for the guests above the wine
the youth of those past days in line
behind her followed wildly dancing
among my friends in all that crowd
my giddy mistress made me proud
When I defected from their union
and ran far off the Muse came too
How often with her sweet communion
shed cheer my wordless way and do
her secret work of magic suasion
How often on the steep Caucasian
ranges Lenoralike shed ride
breakneck by moonlight at my side
How oft shed lead me by the Tauric
seacoast to hear in dark of night
the murmuring Nereids recite
and the deepthroated billows choric
hymnal as endlessly unfurled
they praise the Father of the world
But then oblivious of the city
its glaring feasts and shrill events
in far Moldavia fit for pity
she visited the humble tents
of wandering tribesmen while the ravage
of their society turned her savage
she lost the language of the gods
for the bleak tongue of boorish clods
she loved the steppeland and its singing
then quickly something changed all this
look here as a provincial miss
shes turned up in my garden bringing
sad meditations in her look
and in her hand a small French book
Now for the first time shes escorted
into the social whirlabout
jealously shyly Ive imported
her steppeland charms into a rout
Through the tight ranks  aristocratic
militaryfoppish diplomatic
past the grand ladies see her glide
she sits down calmly on one side
admires the tumult and the pressing
the flickering tones of dress and speech
the young hostess towards whom each
new guest is gradually progressing
while men all sombre all the same
set off the ladies like a frame
She enjoys the stately orchestration
of oligarchical converse
prides icy calm the combination
of ranks and ages so diverse
But who stands there in this selected
assembly silent and dejected
All who behold him find him strange
Faces before him flash and change
like irksome phantoms null as zero
Is spleen his trouble or the dumb
torment of pride And whys he come
Who on earth is he not our hero
No doubt about it its Eugene
How long has he been on the scene
Still as he was has he stopped prancing
does he still pose and play the freak
Now hes returned what roles he dancing
what play will he present this week
For what charade is he apparelled
Is he a Melmoth a Childe Harold
a patriot a cosmopolite
bigot or prude or has he quite
a different mask is he becoming
someone like you and me just nice
At least Ill give him some advice
to drop all that oldfashioned mumming
too long hes hoaxed us high and low
You know him do you Yes and no
However has he earned so vicious
so unforgiving a report
Is it that weve become officious
and prone to censure in our thought
that fiery souls headstrong enthusing
appears offensive or amusing
to the complacent and the null
that wit embarrasses the dull
that we enjoy equating chatter
with deeds that dunces now and then
take wing on spite that serious men
find in the trivial serious matter
that mediocre dress alone
fits us as if it were our own
Blest he who in his youth was truly
youthful who ripened in his time
and as the years went by who duly
grew hardened to lifes frosty clime
who never learnt how dreamers babble
who never scorned the social rabble
at twenty was a fop inbred
at thirty lucratively wed
at fifty would prolong the story
by clearing every sort of debt
who in good time would calmly get
fortune and dignity and glory
who all his life would garner praise
as the perfection of our days
Alas our youth was what we made it
something to fritter and to burn
when hourly we ourselves betrayed it
and it deceived us in return
when our sublimest aspiration
and all our fresh imagination
swiftly decayed beyond recall
like foliage in the rotting fall
Its agony to watch the hollow
sequence of dinners stretch away
to see life as a ritual play
and with the decorous throng to follow
although one in no manner shares
its views its passions or its cares
To be a butt for the malicious
is agony if I may speak
and in the eyes of the judicious
to pass for an affected freak
or for a lamentable manic
a monster of the gens Satanic
or for that Demon of my dream
Onegin  now once more my theme
had killed his best friend in a duel
without a goal on which to fix
lived to the age of twentysix
was finding leisures vacuum cruel
and with no post no work no wife
had nothing to employ his life
He was the slave of a tenacious
a restless urge for change of place
an attribute thats quite vexatious
though some support it with good grace
Hes gone away and left his village
the solitude of woods and tillage
where every day a bloodstained shade
had come to him in field and glade
started a life of pointless roaming
dogged by one feeling only one
and soon his travels had begun
as all things did to bore him homing
like Chatsky he arrived to fall
direct from shipboard into ball
There came a murmur for a fleeting
moment the assembly seemed to shake
that lady the hostess was greeting
with the grand general in her wake
she was unhurried unobtrusive
not cold but also not effusive
no haughty stare around the press
no proud pretentions to success
no mannerism no affectation
no artifices of the vain
No all in her was calm and plain
She struck one as the incarnation
Shishkov forgive me I dont know
the Russian for le comme il faut
Ladies came over crossed to meet her
dowagers smiled as she went by
and bending deeply down to greet her
men made their bows and sought her eye
girls as they passed her spoke less loudly
and no one in the room so proudly
raised nose and shoulders high and wide
as did the general at her side
Youd never class her as a beauty
and yet in her youd not detect
rigorously though youd inspect
what London calls with humble duty
to fashions absolute dictate
a vulgar touch I cant translate
And yet although its past conveying
I really dote upon the word
its new to us beyond gainsaying
from the first moment it was heard
it had its epigrampotential
But lets return to our essential
that lady whose engaging charm
so effortlessly can disarm
She sits with Nina at a table
bright Northern Cleopatra she
but youll undoubtedly agree
that marble Ninas proved unable
to steal away her neighbours light
or dim her dazzle as she might
Can it be she Eugene in wonder
demanded Yes she looks And yet
from deepest backwood furthest under
And every minute his lorgnette
stays fixed and focused on a vision
which has recalled without precision
forgotten features Can you say
prince who in that darkred bret
just there is talking to the Spanish
ambassador In some surprise
the prince looks at him and replies
Wait Ill present you  but you banish
yourself too long from social life
But tell me who she is My wife
Youre married No idea whatever
Since when is this Two years or more
To Larina Tatyana never
She knows you Why we lived next door
So to his wife for presentation
the prince bring up his own relation
and friend Evgeny The princess
gazes at him and nonetheless
however much her soul has faltered
however strongly she has been
moved and surprised she stays serene
and nothing in her look is altered
her manner is no less contained
her bow as calm and as restrained
I dont mean that she never shivered
paled flushed or lost composures grip
no even her eyebrow never quivered
she never even bit her lip
However closely he inspected
there was no trace to be detected
of the old Tatyana Eugene tried
to talk to her but language died
How long hed been here was her query
and where had he arrived from not
from their own country Then she shot
across to her consort a weary
regard and slipped away for good
with Eugene frozen where he stood
Was she the Tanya hed exhorted
in solitude as at the start
of this our novel we reported
in the far backwoods deepest heart
to whom in a fine flow of preaching
he had conveyed some moral teaching
from whom hed kept a letter where
her heart had spoken free as air
untouched by trace of inhibition
could it be she or had he dreamed
the girl hed scorned in what he deemed
the modesty of her condition
could it be she who just had turned
away so cool so unconcerned
Eugene forsakes the packed reception
and home he drives deepsunk in thought
By dreams now sad in their conception
now sweet his slumbers are distraught
He wakes  and who is this who writes him
Prince N respectfully invites him
to a soire My God to her
Ill go Ill go  and in a stir
a swift polite reply is written
What ails him hes in some strange daze
what moves along the hidden ways
in one so slothful so hardbitten
vexation vainness heavens above
it cant be youths distemper  love
Once more he counts the hourbells tolling
once more he cant await the night
now ten has struck his wheels are rolling
he drives there like a bird in flight
hes up the steps with heart aquiver
led to the princess all ashiver
finds her alone and there they sit
some minutes long The words wont fit
on Eugenes lips In his dejection
his awkwardness hes hardly said
a single thing to her His head
is lost in obstinate reflection
and obstinate his look But she
sits imperturbable and free
Her husband enters thus concluding
their unattractive ttette
he and Onegin start alluding
to pranks and jokes of earlier date
They laugh The guests begin arriving
Already now the talk was thriving
on modish malice coarse of grain
but salt near the princess a vein
of unaffectedly fantastic
invention sparkled then gave way
to reasoned talk no dull hearsay
no deathless truths nothing scholastic
and no ones ear could take offence
at such vivacious free good sense
High rank of course and fashions glasses
Saint Petersburgs fine flower was there
the inevitable silly asses
the faces met with everywhere
ladies of riper years delicious
in rosetrimmed bonnets but malicious
a girl or two without a smile
to crack between them for a while
one listened to a chief of mission
on state affairs there was a wit
a greyhaired perfumed exquisite
a joker in the old tradition
acute and subtle  in a word
all that today we find absurd
There with epigrammatic neatness
was one who raged and raged again
against the teas excessive sweetness
the boring wives the illbred men
a novel vague and superficial
two sisters whod received the initial
the lies that in the press run rife
the war the snowfall and his wife
There was   so notorious
through baseness of the soul that he
in albums blunted the censorious
cartoonistpencils of SaintPriest
another of the balldictators
a fashionplate for illustrators
stood in the door cherubic mute
frozen in his tightfitting suit
a farflung traveller who was creaking
with foppery and too much starch
set the guests smiling at his arch
affected pose  and an unspeaking
unanimous exchange of looks
entered his sentence in the books
But my Eugene that night directed
his gaze at Tatyana alone
not the plain timorous dejected
and lovelorn maiden whom hed known
but the unbending goddessdaughter
of Nevas proud imperial water
the imperturbable princess
We all resemble more or less
our Mother Eve were never falling
for whats been given us to take
to his mysterious tree the snake
is calling us for ever calling
and once forbidden fruit is seen
no paradise can stay serene
In Tanya what a transformation
how well shed studied her new role
how soon the bounds of rank and station
had won her loyalty What soul
would have divined the tender shrinking
maiden in this superb unthinking
lawgiver to the modish world
Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled
for him at night before the indulgence
of Morpheus had induced relief
she once had pined in girlish grief
raised a dull eye to moons refulgence
and dreamt that she with him one day
jointly would tread lifes humble way
Love tyrannises all the ages
but youthful virgin hearts derive
a blessing from its blasts and rages
like fields in spring when storms arrive
In passions sluicing rain they freshen
ripen and find a new expression
the vital force gives them the shoot
of sumptuous flowers and luscious fruit
But when a later age has found us
the climacteric of our life
how sad the scar of passions knife
as when chill autumn rains surround us
throw meadows into muddy rout
and strip the forest round about
Alas Eugene beyond all query
is deep in love just like a boy
spends light and darkness in the dreary
brooding that is the lovers ploy
Each day despite the appeals of reason
he drives up in and out of season
to her glass porch pursues her round
close as a shadow on the ground
and bliss for him is when he hotly
touches her hand or throws a fur
around her neck or when for her
he goes ahead and parts the motley
brigade of liveries in the hall
or else lifts up a fallen shawl
But she refuses to perceive him
even if he drops or pines away
At home shell equably receive him
in others houses she may say
a word or two or stare unseeing
or simply bow within her being
coquettishness has got no trace
the grand monde finds it out of place
Meanwhile Onegin starts to languish
she doesnt see or doesnt mind
Onegin wastes youd almost find
hes got consumption In his anguish
some vote a doctor for the case
others prescribe a wateringplace
But go he wont for him a letter
fixing an early rendezvous
with his forefathers would seem better
but she for women thats not new
remains unmoved still hes persistent
active and hopeful and insistent
his illness lends him courage and
to the princess in his weak hand
he sends a letter penned with passion
He deemed in general letters vain
and rightly so but now his pain
had gone in no uncertain fashion
past all endurance Youre referred
to Eugenes letter word for word
Onegins Letter to Tatyana
I know it all my secret ache
will anger you in its confession
What scorn I see in the expression
that your proud glance is sure to take
What do I want what am I after
stripping my soul before your eyes
I know to what malicious laughter
my declaration may give rise
I noticed once at our chance meeting
in you a tender pulse was beating
yet dared not trust what I could see
I gave no rein to sweet affection
what held me was my predilection
my tedious taste for feeling free
And then to part us in full measure
Lensky that tragic victim died
From all sweet things that gave me pleasure
since then my heart was wrenched aside
freedom and peace in substitution
for happiness I sought and ranged
unloved and friendless and estranged
What folly and what retribution
No every minute of my days
to see you faithfully to follow
watch for your smile and catch your gaze
with eyes of love with greed to swallow
your words and in my soul to explore
your matchlessness to seek to capture
its image then to swoon before
your feet to pale and waste what rapture
But Im denied this all for you
I drag my footsteps hither yonder
I count each hour the whole day through
and yet in vain ennui I squander
the days that doom has measured out
And how they weigh I know about
my span that fortunes jurisdiction
has fixed but for my heart to beat
I must wake up with the conviction
that somehow that same day well meet
I dread your stern regard surmising
in my petition an approach
a calculation past despising
I hear the wrath of your reproach
How fearful in and out of season
to pine away from passions thirst
to burn  and then by force of reason
to stem the bloodstreams wild outburst
how fearful too is my obsession
to clasp your knees and at your feet
to sob out prayer complaint confession
and every plea that lips can treat
meanwhile with a dissemblers duty
to cool my glances and my tongue
to talk as if with heart unwrung
and look serenely on your beauty
But so it is Im in no state
to battle further with my passion
Im yours in a predestined fashion
and I surrender to my fate
No answer comes Another letter
he sends a second then a third
No answer comes He goes for better
or worse to a soire Unheard
she appears before him grim and frozen
No look no word for him shes chosen
to encase herself inside a layer
of Twelfth Nights chillest iciest air
To batten down their indignation
is all those stubborn lips desire
Onegin looks with eyes of fire
where are distress commiseration
No tearstains nothing Wrath alone
is graven on that face of stone
Perhaps some secret apprehension
lest signs of casual weakness drew
her husbands or the worlds attention
Ah all that my Onegin knew
No hope no hope He leaves the revel
wishes his madness to the devil
drives home  and plunging deeper in
once more renounces world and din
And he remembers in the quiet
of his own room how cruel spleen
had once before across the scene
of social buzz and modish riot
tracked him and put him in duress
and locked him in a dark recess
Once more he turned to books unchoosing
devouring Gibbon and Rousseau
Manzoni and Chamfort perusing
Madame de Stal Bichat Tissot
Herder and even at times a Russian
nothing was barred beyond discussion
he read of course the sceptic Bayle
and all the works of Fontanelle
almanacs journals of reflection
where admonitions are pronounced
where nowadays Im soundly trounced
but where such hymns in my direction
were chanted I remember when
e sempre bene gentlemen
What happened Though his eyes were reading
his thoughts were on a distant goal
desires and dreams and griefs were breeding
and swarming in his inmost soul
Between the lines of text as printed
his minds eye focused on the hinted
purport of other lines intense
was his absorption in their sense
Legends and mystical traditions
drawn from a dim warmhearted past
dreams of inconsequential cast
rumours and threats and premonitions
long lively tales from wonderland
or letters in a young girls hand
Then gradually upon sensation
and thought a sleepy numbness steals
before his eyes imagination
brings out its faro pack and deals
He sees in slush stretched out and keeping
motionless as one soundly sleeping
in bed a young man stiff and chilled
he hears a voice well what hes killed
And foes he sees longsince forgotten
a rogue a slanderer a poltroon
young traitresses by the platoon
comrades despised and comrades rotten
a country house  and one who still
sits there beside the windowsill
He got so used to this immersion
he almost lost his mind expired
or joined us poets His conversion
would have been all that we required
Its true the magnetlike attraction
of Russian verse its force in action
my inept pupil at that hour
so nearly had them in his power
Who could have looked the poet better
as in the nook hed sit alone
by blazing fireplace and intone
Idol mio or Benedetta
and on the flames let fall unseen
a slipper or a magazine
The days flew past by now the season
in warmer airs was half dispersed
Hes neither died nor lost his reason
nor turned a poet In the burst
of spring he lives hes energetic
he leaves one morning the hermetic
apartment where a double glaze
has kept him warm in chimneys blaze
while marmotlike he hibernated
along the Neva in a sleigh
past iceblocks blue and squared away
he drives in brilliant sun striated
along the street lies dirty snow
and like an arrow from a bow
over the slush where is he chasing
Youve guessed before it all began
to his Tatyana yes hes racing
my strange incorrigible man
He goes inside corpselike of feature
the halls without a living creature
the big room further not a cat
He opens up a door Whats that
that strikes him with such force and meaning
The princess sitting peaked and wan
alone with no adornment on
she holds a letter up and leaning
cheek upon hand she softly cries
in a still stream that never dries
Who in that flash could not have reckoned
her full account of voiceless pain
Who in the princess for that second
would not have recognized again
our hapless Tanya An emotion
of wild repentance and devotion
threw Eugene at her feet  she stirred
and looked at him without a word
without surprise or rage his laden
his humbly suppliant approach
his dull sick look his dumb reproach
she sees it all The simple maiden
whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive
in her once more has come alive
Tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling
looks at him with a steady gaze
allows her hand thats lost all feeling
to meet his thirsty lips What daze
what dream accounts for her distraction
A pause of silence and inaction
then quietly at last says she
Enough stand up Its now for me
to give you honest explanation
Onegin dyou recall the day
when in the park in the alle
where fate had fixed our confrontation
humbly I heard your lesson out
Today its turn and turn about
For then Onegin I was younger
and also prettier Ill be bound
whats more I loved you but my hunger
what was it in your heart it found
that could sustain it Only grimness
for you I think the humble dimness
of lovelorn girls was nothing new
But now  oh God  the thought of you
your icy look your stern dissuasion
freezes my blood Yet all the same
nothing you did gave cause for blame
you acted well that dread occasion
you took an honourable part
Im grateful now with all my heart
Then in the backwoods far from rumour
and empty gossip youll allow
Id nothing to attract your humour
Why then do you pursue me now
What cause has won me your attention
Could it not be that by convention
I move in the grand monde that rank
and riches and the wish to thank
my husband for his wounds in battle
earn us the favour of the Court
that for all this my shames report
would cause widespread remark and tattle
and so in the salons could make
a tempting plume for you to take
I weep In case there still should linger
your Tanyas image in your mind
then know that your reproving finger
your cold discourse were less unkind
if I had power to choose your fashion
than this humiliating passion
and than these letters and these tears
At least you then showed for my years
respect and mercy for my dreaming
But now what brings you to my feet
What trifling could be more complete
What power enslaves you with your seeming
advantages of heart and brain
to all thats trivial and inane
To me Onegin all this glory
is tinsel on a life I hate
this modish whirl this social story
my house my evenings all that state
whats in them All this loud parading
and all this flashy masquerading
the glare the fumes in which I live
this very day Id gladly give
give for a bookshelf a neglected
garden a modest home the place
of our first meeting face to face
and the churchyard where newerected
a humble cross in woodland gloom
stands over my poor nurses tomb
Bliss was so near so altogether
attainable But now my lot
is firmly cast I dont know whether
I acted thoughtlessly or not
you see with tears and incantation
mother implored me my sad station
made all fates look the same and so
I married I beseech you go
I know your heart it has a feeling
for honour a straightforward pride
I love you whats the use to hide
behind deceit or doubledealing
but Ive become anothers wife
and Ill be true to him for life
She went  and Eugene all emotion
stood thunderstruck In what wild round
of tempests in what raging ocean
his heart was plunged A sudden sound
the clink of rowels met his hearing
Tatyanas husband now appearing
But from the hero of my tale
just at this crisis of his gale
reader we must be separating
for long for evermore Weve chased
him far enough through wild and waste
Hurrah lets start congratulating
ourselves on our landfall Its true
our vessels long been overdue
Reader I wish that as we parted
whoever you may be a friend
a foe  our mood should be warmhearted
Goodbye for now we make an end
Whatever in this rough confection
you sought  tumultuous recollection
a rest from toil and all its aches
or just grammatical mistakes
a vivid brush a witty rattle
God grant that from this little book
for hearts delight or fun you took
for dreams or journalistic battle
God grant you took at least a grain
On this well part goodbye again
And my companion so mysterious
goodbye to you my true ideal
my task so vivid and so serious
and yet so light All that is real
and enviable for a poet
in your pursuit Ive come to know it
oblivion of lifes stormy ways
sweet talk with friends How many days
since through the mist that dreams arise on
young Tanya first appeared to me
Onegin too  and there to see
a free romances far horizon
still dim through crystals magic glass
before my gaze began to pass
Of those who heard my opening pages
in friendly gatherings where I read
as Sadi sang in earlier ages
some are far distant some are dead
Theyve missed Eugenes completed etching
But she who modelled for the sketching
of Tanyas image Ah how great
the toll of those borne off by fate
Blest he whos left the hurlyburly
of lifes repast betimes nor sought
to drain its beaker down nor thought
of finishing its book but early
has wished it an abrupt goodbye
and with my Eugene so have I
